Comedy Bang Bang Appearances
----------------------------

Comedy Bang Bang is an alt-comedy improv podcast published at least
weekly since 2009. Each episode features one or more guests, who may be
playing themselves or an improvised character. As of 2020-05-16, there
have been 699 mainline episodes with 492 unique guests.

At the end of the year, listeners vote on the best episodes of the year
(Thanksgiving-to-Thanksgiving), which are compiled in year-end Best Of
episodes that are published over the Christmas-New Year break. Paul F.
Tompkins, the most frequent CBB guest, typically cohosts these shows
with the show's host, Scott Aukerman.

I scraped the data directly from the Earwolf website using the
`scrape-earwolf.R`, and then created the image via
`cbb-bestof-figure.R`. The top 9 most frequently Best Of'd guests are
highlighted by color, and the Best Of episodes are shaded grey.
