Comedy Bang Bang is an alt-comedy improv podcast published at least weekly since 2009. Each episode features one or more guests, who may be playing themselves or an improvised character. As of 2020-01-20, there have been 681 mainline episodes with 482 unique guests.

At the end of the year, listeners vote on the best episodes of the year (Thanksgiving-to-Thanksgiving), which are compiled in year-end Best Of episodes that are published over the Christmas-New Year break. Paul F. Tompkins, the most frequent CBB guest, typically cohosts these shows with the show's host, Scott Aukerman.

I scraped the data directly from the Earwolf website using the `scrape-earwolf.R`, and then created the image via `cbb-bestof-figure.R`. The top 9 most frequently Best Of'd guests are highlighted by color, and the Best Of episodes are shaded grey.
