The peak Gabrus was probably #293 Monster Muscles, which is the 1a and 1b with Exorcism of Cake Boss as best Riddle Me This performance. Tony Macaroni was the best Claudia.

* 272 Sex Party Season

A few notes about some of my picks that are... a little off-kilter. A little... left-of-center. Some might say... unconventional:

-Drunk Jon Daly almost booted DJs are Sleaze Js from my top 10 but Merrill and Jenny were way too charming. I listened to their Don't Take it Personal collabo (collaboration) one hundred times and a great non-PFT Would You Rather. 

-5th Anniversary was Lapkus's first transcendent appearance for me, which made me go back and listen to everything she ever did and appreciate it more than ever. I perhaps should have included more Lapkus.

-Canadian Apparel was wonderful Adomian-other-guest interaction, almost rivaling the sublime Amy Poehler (#176 Out of Bleeps) and Maria Bamford (#243 Blow Me Up Tom) appearances. AND Wengert's amazing Brad Hammerstone charac. 

-Little Button Puss was a great surprise, booted up that pod with low expectations as I don't get the pre-pod jitters from any of these guests on name alone, but soon found myself howling. 

-Didn't put Womptacular on here out of protest to St. Clair getting a little one note / burying the lead with the Wompler character. It's a pretty glaring omission and I'm pretty broken up about it. I will keep you updated, gang, as I cope with this.

In my experience most people either skip the ads or zone out for them. Why? Because they're boring as fuck. No matter who is reading them with what flourishes generally, they are exactly the same. So complaining about Hayes and Sean doing bits during the ads is like..complaining about there being too many fights in Hockey or too few grind related quests in an MMO. This shit is there to break the monotony.  To make something dull a little less so. 

But even given THAT, the comment sounds dicky. There are ways you can phrase a dislike for something without sounding vaguely inflammatory.  No one says you have to like HH. In fact, I'll upvote a comment about disliking HH as long as OP respects the fact that other people do like it. Something along the lines of ""I'm not a huge fan of these guys because (X)."" or ""It's just not my thing because (y)."" That's totally fair. It's not for everyone. And comments like that engender empathy and respect. I'm not a huge Andy Daly fan, but you don't see me going on his CBB ep threads and saying shit like ""hopefully when Andy Daly's CC show starts back up, he'll be too busy to be on CBB anymore."" People love that dude and I respect that they do and I see why. He's just not for me.

So do you remember those commercials with the talking baby in his crib, pitching a stock market app or something similar? Pete Holmes voiced that baby over the span of that commercial campaign. There were several different commercials in that campaign and they played often. We can safely assume Pete Holmes made a significant amount of money off of doing the baby's voice. It also didn't hurt his career or fame.

Well when Glaser comes out - in front of the other guests (Glaser's peers) and in front of a big live audience - Pete casually mentions how he beat out Glaser to voice the baby. Like I guess it was down to Glaser and Holmes as the final 2. Glaser is shocked that Pete would say this, he's dumbfounded that Pete can be so thoughtless/careless/unprofessional, he has embarrassed Glaser in front of all these people, and so on. Glaser lets him know it's not a bit. He's upset and offended. Pete doesn't really know what to do or how to recover. Now Pete's embarrassed - he's not an asshole, he's just an idiot. He didn't mean to hurt Glaser but didn't think to consider his feelings before opening his big yap. Glaser doesn't leave the stage or storm off or anything. But goddamn it is cringe material. The episode never fully recovers. It lingers.

I think I've explained it pretty well and you don't need to go listen to it at this point unless you enjoy that sort of supreme awkward cringe where you feel awkward and bad *for* someone.

I would have my Mom drive us to UCB Franklin, long before Sunset existed, to see the live taping since it was free. Could be that since it was always before the live Comedy Death-Ray I found CDR Radio through that. 

You're totally right though. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't proud of my sense of humor. I always feel so accomplished... or proud... or some weird mix of the two when I recognize a CBB or UCB alum in something more in the public eye. Despite the fact no one ever knows who I'm talking about.

When I think about aspects of my life and what's important to me, podcasts are high up on the list. I mean shit, if every episode of every podcast somehow disappeared? Well I don't know how I'd ever get to sleep in certain situations. Podcasts have made listening to music kind of boring..... and I'm a musician.

When I had first met her back at college, she had said she spent her high school years going to shows there, like it was no big deal, which was incredible to me. I can't remember what day or show it was, but I got to see Zouks and Seth Morris. She also took me to see a Meltdown show which had a lineup of Kroll, Jeselnik, Tig, John Roy, Zach Galifianakis, and two other heavy hitters I can't quite recall at the moment. When you go deep into an art like comedy or music, local scenes take precedence over ""famous"" acts - I'm into the Chicago comedy scene, and I've got my local heroes, but to have those *be* the famous acts is insane. 

I've definitely got this pride that I never see the light of day that whispers, ""I was there first,"" or ""Comedy is cool now? Oh that's nice. My classmates didn't think so back in 5th grade when I told them I downloaded six bootleg Lewis Black sets from the Clinton Administration.""

So many of the current big names in LA have either headlined or been a member of the cast. They're probably the best taste of and tastemakers for what Chicago comedy is if you want a general overview. Then, follow the performers on social media. They're always sharing other, related shows that they're a part of. The scene has an atmosphere that is very DIY and very communal. Other great showcases are [Comedians You Should Know](https://www.facebook.com/ComediansYouShouldKnow/) at O'Toole's, and [Chicago Underground Comedy](https://www.facebook.com/chicagoundergroundcomedy/) at the Beat Kitchen (talk about adjacency to the music scene). Also, read the [Whiskey Journal](http://www.thewhiskeyjournal.com/), it's like The Onion, and is run by Chicago guys.

These are great starting points, and it's not even all that comprehensive. Chicago is a big place, but eventually you'll find your way into a deeper, weirder place: three or four years ago, I went to a show that was hosted in someone's apartment in Andersonville. It was this new experimental type of comedy show where the audience was placed in front of a projector screen in the living room. The comics were in the bathroom on the other side of the apartment wearing gigantic gun range ear protection performing to a camera that had a live feed to the projector. They were doing their set, but couldn't tell how the audience was reacting. The anxiety gave their performances a weird, jittery, suicidal energy.

Being a musician, I know the DIY music scene well. I've played at a lot of DIY spots, as well as at the Subterranean, and the Beat Kitchen.  It sounds like there are comedy shows at DIY spots, too, huh? That's really cool, and I'm excited to see what weird stuff is happening. 

Do you know if there's a Facebook group for the DIY comedy scene like there is for the music scene? That's where I get all the info about music shows happening around the city. 

I love music, and I love performing it, but all I really want to do is go see good comedy and perform good comedy. I've done stuff at shitty open mics at coffee houses, but I don't think that's really my scene. It sounds like the underground scene is a lot more welcoming when it comes to weirder stuff.

I hated that DIY Chicago facebook group, and by extension the scene, so much. It's all clicqueishness and horseshit bickering over nonsense. It is so childish. It feels like a bunch of teenagers who've finally run out of things to rebel against so they do it to each other by asserting their version of ""punk ethos"" over the scene and everyone in it. 

And that's the key - that the entire scene is comprised of variations of punk music, whether it's poppunk, or garagepunk, or emo, or scramz, or hardcore, or whatever. It's all just homogeneity. No group of human beings is going to be 100% kumbaya. But the comedy scene has club comics, and alt comics, and theater comics, and southside comics, and northside comics, and suburban comics, and black white Latino Asian and so many different types of comics and if there ever is a dispute, at least there's room to breath. At least, that's the way that I see the difference. 

Most of the time, most people are pretty cool to each other. 

The only other observation I have about the differences between the two is that the music scene, I think, views their work as a party with the benefit of also playing music, whereas the comedy scene really has a bunch of hustlers and go getters, which lends itself to playing nice.",Comedy Bang Bang #485: The 8th Anniversary Show!,,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-8th-anniversary-show/,earwolf.com,http://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/68km28/comedy_bang_bang_485_the_8th_anniversary_show/?ref=search_posts

Also you're spot on about the music scene being about partying first and the music second. I play electronic music, and my friends who are involved in the scene play more psych/shoegaze/experimental stuff, so I never really felt like I fit in with the super authentic punk kids. There are some great bands here, but also some pretty mediocre ones that all sound the same. I've noticed that a lot of the people who go to shows don't even watch the bands, they just go to smoke, drink and socialize. 

I'm excited to check out what the city has to offer in terms of comedy, always knew it was there, just never really knew where to look. Thanks for the info.

I don't know why I never thought of that until your post!  We had Dr. Demento which we would record off the air and ride bikes over to a friends house to listen.

In early 2011, I found myself a stay-at-home dad with a newborn.  We had just cancelled cable and I had downloaded a bunch of shows to watch while the baby was sleeping once I'd finished the house cleaning.

Well guess you never slept!  And guess who never finished the house cleaning!

So I decided I should download some podcasts because I can listen to those and walk around!  I had listened to a lot of podcasts before, NPR, language lessons, stuff you should know, etc.  But I didn't want anything too heady... Something I could put on in the background. 

I was also exhausted. So I wanted something that would make me laugh and I wanted something with a deep catalog so I could binge listen.  I typed in ""Comedy"" and in the search results was ""Something for Daddy.""  I clicked on it and there were about 100 episodes of ""Comedy Death Ray.""  ""Perfect, let's try it.""

Patton Oswalt was a guest, so I was confident I'd get some laughs in.  I had no idea what was going on with the Don Dimello, but my confusion only made it funnier that episode won me over.

218,55,01-05-17,01-05-17,303,Earwolf,0.98,354,CatsLikeToMeow,lakeradio,33,0,"In honor of the anniversary, I'd be interested in hearing what lead y'all to listen to CBB in the first place, which episode it was, and what your initial reaction was. Maybe we can share what the show means to us, if that isn't too sappy? I think it's important to recognize and celebrate good things while they are still happening, rather than wait to eulogize them when they come to an end. 

For me; I have been listening to CBB since almost the beginning. My first episode was way back at episode #28, where PFT is impersonating John C Reilly, and Jon Daly was doing Cosby (I don't remember if it was Cosby-Bukowski, or just straight Cosby). 

I thought Reilly was actually on the show, and wondering why he was saying such strange things (this was pre-Brule). It finally clicked when I heard Jon Daly doing his Cosby impression. 

I don't recall it being a great episode, but it was good enough for me to listen the week after that, and I sure am glad I stuck with it. 

CBB has been a constant in my life for my entire adult life, and I take it for granted sometimes. What a magical thing Scott has created. I hope it's not too cheesy to say that the show has had a big impact on me as a person. 

I'm also a little embarrassed to say how much the show means me. Many times, it's been a source of happiness when I didn't have much to be happy about. I'm sure some of you guys can relate. 

And the show has been such an amazing gateway to other great things! So many TV shows, comedians, actors, music, movies, other podcasts, etc, have been because I listened to CBB first.

I've been into stand-up and SNL since I was like 8, but probably 95% of the comedy stuff I'm into is because I decided to listen to a Comedy Death Ray episode one day. I shudder to think about all the cool stuff I might have missed out on if it wasn't for this show. 

I'm glad it's been going on for 8 years. I'm glad that I found it and stuck with it. I'm glad that future generations might find the show and appreciate it the same way we do. I'll be more upset than I'd like to admit when the show comes to an end, but I'm grateful that it exists and that I'll be able to go back and listen whenever I want. 

My great-grandmother, who lived to be 100, used to sing old songs and radio jingles absentmindedly. She wasn't always aware what was going on around her in her later years, but  she still remembered those old tunes. I'm suspect she sang them as a way to keep herself connected to who she was as a young person, and sort of visit and relive the memories she made in her long life. 

I have no doubt that if I make it to 100, I'll be singing the Hollywood Facts theme song without realizing it, and it will totally make my great-grandchildren, or nurses or whoever is around me feel weirded out. 

What a special show this is. And, geez what an episode, look at that line-up! Very excited to listen.

I started in 2013, and I would listened to the old episodes in between the new ones. The one that made me really fall in love with this show was Episode 222, with Paul F Tompkins, Gillian Jacobs, and Mike Hanford. That was also when they did video podcasts on YouTube, way back in the day haha. I laughed hard so many times in that episode, I still will revisit it. 
I got to see the tour live in Atlanta, and it was amazing. I'm 20 now, and the past 4 years really shaped me into what I like, and it's because of this dumb show.

So obviously CBB has been doing just fine and dandy without my input but I am curious... Did Nick Kroll just sit there for 2.5 hours and not say anything? I understand introducing each character individually so that they can build out their background, etc. Some of the funniest parts, though, happen once everyone has been introduced and are pitching in. Wouldn't it be better if Scott introduced all the recurring characters at the top of the show and then allowed any new character to be introduced a little later this way everyone can interact the entire show? 

Any insight as to why they ""waste"" these characters?

I wish you wouldn't make dismissive comments like this. It's pretty clear why some people aren't into Esposito if you listen to the episodes she's been on. I don't have any examples on me but there are multiple times where she isn't fully on board with a bit and just goes ""Huh?"" or ""What?"" and inadvertently shuts the whole thing down instead of just letting them go. She also never really plays along with the characters and from what I remember of her barely talks after her interview. The worst thing you can do on an improv podcast is to ignore/not interact with the characters or to shut down bits and she does both which makes episodes she is in quantifiably less funny than they could have been. She's just not a comedian that meshes with improv.

He engages, chooses the right times to intervene, and knows how far to push a gag or premise. That's what makes for my favorite eps. In the early days of CBB, the show was like this more consistently, and it allowed for a greater amount of sustained weirdness and complicated premises that build over the course of the episode for a big payoff.

When Scott has up-and-coming UCBers, he's more inclined to steamroll and derail. It feels like maybe there's less motivation to work hard to stay interested and less trust that what the guest is doing will go somewhere. I totally get itI'd probably be the same way as a host. But that's what makes me enjoy those eps less. They tend to have a bunch of isolated bits, a few of which make me laugh. They seldom stray from the show's formula. If nothing else, there's a less fun atmosphere in the room.

If it were possible to treat every guest the way Scott treats Jon Hamm, I think it'd be an amazing thing for the show.","Face Fox, episode #494 of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast",,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/face-fox/,earwolf.com,http://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/6jjl66/face_fox_episode_494_of_comedy_bang_bang_the/?ref=search_posts

I think comedies are too subjective to review and that movie reviewers in general (not all) are stupid assholes. My favorite comedy, Wet Hot American Summer, only has a 6.7 on imdb and probably would have had about a 20% on rotten tomatoes when it came out.

My opinion is that you should see the House if you like Jason or Will or Amy. It was the worst of the 3 movies I saw this weekend (the others being Baby Driver twice and the Big Sick), but it also made me laugh a lot more. I've seen it twice now and enjoyed it more the second time.

If I'm trying to be objective I would say it's an average to above average comedy by today's standards and should have had about a 65 on rotten tomatoes. It has some funny performances by a lot of earwolf people (Kroll, Huebel, Scovel, and Lennon Parham especially), but it suffered from poor editing and a sloppy ending.

It is definitely Will's best comedy in at least 5 years and it's also the worst reviewed (I've seen probably 3 or 4 of them). It's probably better than Sisters and Baby Mama (although I didn't really enjoy either of these) and those are both in the 60s on rotten tomatoes. The reason this has such a low rating is because it is just trying to be a comedy and not some sweet message about life with some jokes attached, and also the issues I mentioned above. Go see it and judge for yourself.","Who CBBeefed?, episode #495 of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast on Earwolf (w/ Jason Mantzoukas, Mary Holland, and Tim Baltz)",,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/who-cbbeefed/,earwolf.com,http://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/6k6q3n/who_cbbeefed_episode_495_of_comedy_bang_bang_the/?ref=search_posts

-Classic Gino. He did all the same bits he's done his other forty appearances -- thinks he's in charge of sound; confused about what podcasts are; spends too much to fly out; annoys Scott; too skinny; gets excited about racism/sexism; starts telling a story that would only happen to Gabrus, then forced to backtrack -- and they're still funny. Plus, now we know he has a small penis and no car. 

-Morpheus, The Dreamlord was perfect. The absurdity, omniscience, and stupidity of his ""we're in a dream/I know everything everyone has ever dreamt/I only know things people dream"" set up is deeply and universally funny.

-Great character from Holly Prizaff. Love characters who are evasive on their intriguing and puzzling backstories.

-Favorite moment: Gino's parallelogram blindness explanation forcing a descent into the deeper inception dream-world where we meet Dreamlord Gus.

The only drawback I can see to it being on TruTV is that they will probably have to censor the language a lot; the pilot episode I watched was an uncensored version and a lot of the humor derives from the unfiltered cursing (a big plot point in the first episode is Andrea's character accidentally ending up cursing around kids).

I was thinking about the breakdown of the doughboys double last week since we can see how much money they make. After patreon takes like 10%, the double makes around $13000 a month.

Edit: This might be part of the reason they only have 1 guest at a time on Doughboys.

Mary Holland is a pro at making her entrance hilarious. Had some classics back with Kroll playing so many ridiculous characters. Mary Holland actually did good in the freestyle rap battle. I'm always shocked when people do good at that. The entire script read with Cal Solomon was great. Reminded me of some of Ice T's ridiculous invention bits in terms of how long it went on and how innocent Cal was in it.

Finally, can't forget about our Co host zouks. Just crushed it. Jason is the perfect straight man for CBB because he's practically a character himself.

*How are you? Why am I asking that, I'm sure you're great - you've been absolutely killing it lately. Me? I dunno man, I'm not so good. I really thought I had that whole president thing in the bag. I really thought that shit was finally mine, but it slipped through my hands like so many years slip through all of our fingers. For I think we can all agree, the real villain isn't ISIS. The biggest villain of them all, the biggest villain of all time... is time.* 

*You know, time. That little thing that tick-tocks on your wrist watch, that little thing that tells you you're late, that little thing that tells you you're old. But I don't like to think in terms of age. Age is in the mind, and my mind's a baby. My mind is a little, little baby that just shit its diaper, and it's some stinky shit too. It's the type of shit that comes from eating big girl's food -- mmm. I love big girl's food. Always have. Fuck baby food. Baby food is for cowards. Did you know I started eating steak when I was one? Not many people know that. Not even Bill knows that. Why would I tell him? It's none of his fuckin' business. Nothing about me is anyone's fuckin' business. I keep the door to me LOCKED. I guess that's why people are always trying to break it down, but they don't break doors down. I do.* 

*You best believe, for any supposed locked door -- I busted in that motherfucker, and made it my house. The White House was my house! It might have been Bill and Barack's fuckin' job, but it was my house. Oh! I miss that house. I miss sleeping there. I was ready for it to be my house again. But I guess America wasn't ready. America decided to think a whiny voice was worse than grabbing pussies. I guess that's the America we live in now. Maybe it's the America we've always lived in.* 

*So, I understand you're going on Comedy Bang Bang tomorrow -- do you mind if I get honest for a second here, Brett? I don't know why you keep doing that show, you're obviously above it. You're not just some schmuck who likes to spit out empty fuckin' jokes, and do stupid one-dimensional characters. You're an artist. A true artist.* 

*Ah, I'll never forget the first time I saw you at the Upright Citizen's Brigade Theatre. It was an amazing bit, where you sat onstage and said you were going to be the audience for a change, and the audience would be the comedian, that's what most of you assholes think you are, right? And that's what you fuckin' think I am, you fuckin' think I'm YOUR audience. Then you sat down and watched them, but not just that. You heckled them. I remember you told one audience member ""nice shirt, where'd you buy it? American Never Gets Laid Apparel?"" Ha ha ha. Then you told another audience member that their facial expression made them look like they pissed their pants! Then after that, all that heckling, you got up and said ""this sucks, you guys are the worst comedian I've ever seen, I'm outta here!"" Then you stormed off the stage and you didn't return. I felt that awkwardness in the air, and the audience wanted you to come back to applaud you, but you didn't give it to them.* 

*Holy shit, that blew my mind. You absolutely ignited that stage. I wish I could take the stage like you, but that's not my bag. My bag is phone calls. I can make a phone call that will knock your socks off. I could make a phone call that could convince Greenland to change their name to Iceland Junior! But the way you take that stage? I needed that stagecraft. I should have followed my instincts that night I saw you and asked you to be my stage coach, but I didn't. I guess I didn't do a lot of things I should have done, but hindsight is 20/20.*

*Anyway, I hope CBB goes well. Don't let that fuckhead Scott Aukerman get in your head, he needs you -- you don't need him. And he knows that, and that's why he treats you the way he does. He resents the fact that you are more than he is. I hope we can hang soon, but to be honest I don't really feel like hanging out with anybody right now. Not that I'm that depressed, it's just people are assholes. And the biggest asshole of all time is Scott Aukerman.*

*Love,*

Not that I don't love all these other characters too, they're all charming and among my favorites, but Mike is like PFT's version of Gino, a character that says a lot of the same thing that the performer would say but with a few hilarious traits to fall back on. 

Also, I love when people mention other people in the room like when I think Cameron said ""We were watching Behind the Music on Chris Gaines with our friend Tawny"" with Tawny right there. Especially since a few minutes later, Paul tried to get Scott to mention him and he refused.

It does, however, come up in 100% of everything they do which makes them very 1 dimensional from the get go. But that's not a problem.

 Sexuality never comes up with the pure hilarious joy of James Adomian, Todd Glass, more. To me the issue with them is they just don't generate comedy. They only provide banter and play well with others to keep conversation flowing.

To me, they don't have any memorable LOL moments like other non-character guests like Claudia O Doherty, Ben Schwartz, Hey Nong....even non pro comedians like the Orphan Black gang were naturally funnier.","Popcorn Costume, episode #507 of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast",,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/popcorn-costume/,earwolf.com,http://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/6xyvm8/popcorn_costume_episode_507_of_comedy_bang_bang/?ref=search_posts

Todd Glass didn't come out untill 2012. If you listen to his show he still struggles to say the words gay or boyfriend. The only reason their sexuality was brought up was because they're married (which had only been legal for 4 years), its about their life.

Adomian is 16 years younger than Glass and only one year older than Esposito. The career gap between Glass and Adomian is also far larger than the gap between Adomian and Esposito. The age and career gap is slightly larger between Adomian and Butcher but still closer than Adomian and Glass. 

Social mores can definitely change a lot over a year or two, but not  more than they would over a decade plus. And that age gap should also be considered as to why Glass came out the same year that Adomian released an album that dealt with his sexuality. 

And again, I think it's worth noting that more often than not Adomian is on CBB as a character, which is not the case for Esposito and Butcher. If they were on as different characters who always happened to be lesbians then the comparison would be valid, but they're on as themselves who happen to be comedians who draw material from their personal lives, so them talking about being gay women is germain to their appearing on the show.","Popcorn Costume, episode #507 of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast",,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/popcorn-costume/,earwolf.com,http://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/6xyvm8/popcorn_costume_episode_507_of_comedy_bang_bang/?ref=search_posts

Often it's not even explicit in the mind of the person espousing sexist opinions.

Being called ""too political"" when raising facts about legislation or public policy that affect their very real life on a daily basis. Being perceived as shallow or having petty concerns when talking about things outside the traditional cishet white male frame of reference.

Not the case. In this episode they talked about (amongst many other things) being married, going to games together, making a show together, and going on the road together.

I perform a lot and the women I perform with often have a harder time getting initial laughs than their teammates. I've found this place though, to be way more open minded than UCBNY, which is very much a shitty comedy high school. 

I personally think funny trumps everything around here. Some of the all-time favorites from Earwolf are women and when Prof Blastoff was going on, Tig was on the Earwolf Mt. Rushmore. Stephanie Is praised almost endlessly. 

actually don't know how many gay women actually are on Earwolf-- I only really think about Cameron and Rhea (and much less Rhea who I think is super super funny) when I think about any performers who get flick for their sexuality. Shit, even Zouks gets flack now for being a guy who screams about cum sometimes instead of being a good improv player. 

Another factor that could be a contributor to the shitty sentiment around here-- I'm not sure how many multi-time guests there are that don't slay. Usually people that aren't super well-liked by most don't come back. In the morning I actually want to look into this. 

Anyway-- I think your points are definitely valid for some people. I also think a lot of people just don't know why CBB keeps bringing back guests who don't really mesh super well with the style.

Three Busy Debras is honestly one of my favorite comedy things period, and I'm sure they've earned their stripes by now but it's sadly believable even they wouldn't get due credit immediately for the freakish talents that they are. 

It's a tough area to make qualitative assertions on, I guess another reason why sexism is so pernicious and ingrained. I think content is something to consider, and presentation. 

Tig has a very historically-masculine presentation in terms of her delivery and dry, sardonic, cutting witticism. And it would be dishonest (if shitty) to not note her physical appearance and voice not being what culturally we would stereotype as feminine. The Wild Horses does not shy away from femininity, but they have a tendency to go very blue -- shit/dick/pussy humor, another historically/stereotypically masculine trait in comedy. 

Additionally, both Tig and Wild Horses are undeniably at the height of the form. Tig is one of the greatest standups alive, and Wild Horses is one of the greatest improv groups performing. Allynne is also married to Tig and has collaborated with her extensively. She's associated with some of the strongest (creatively) women in comedy, all of whom -- and I think this is important -- have been crowned and labeled as ""Very Good And Legit"" *by respected men in comedy.*

Now, consider Butcher and Esposito. Both are undeniably very, very good at what they do, but it's not talking out of school to point out they are not in the ultra-elite club of funny women who have *an overwhelming consensus and vocal support of the respected men in comedy.* Yes, dudes like PFT and Auckerman have consistently championed their talents, but they aren't getting name-dropped by men on a regular basis or showcased in male-dominated publications. And while they may have a tomboy-ish fashion style, in content they are more aggressively feminine, and unabashed in their gayness. 

Tig is gay but never talks about it, neither does Stephanie really. That's not a knock on them, they should do whatever they want to do, but again I think that's relevant. 

Also, I honestly believe vocal tone is a strong and deeply instinctual trigger for men. Rhea sounds more masculine than Cameron, I would say that's a legitimate factor in how she is perceived amongst communities such as r/Earwolf. 

So let's run it down: Esposito is a woman who sounds stereotypically feminine, has stereotypically feminine features, but dresses in a style that could be described as ""butch"" and is unapologetic about talking about her life as a gay woman. She also isn't afraid to take up space in conversation, and has an air of self-satisfaction about her craft -- a trait accepted and in fact encouraged in men, but culturally contemptible in women. 

It's like the perfect storm for misogynistic hate! So many things men are programmed from a very young age to believe what a woman should look and act like, she isn't. That cognitive dissonance creates contempt and vitriol that is absolutely rooted in sexist implicit bias. She has to be 10x as good as any man to get half the respect. 

This dissection of physical appearance is objectifying and gross, but I believe it could add value for men here reading. To consider how these things you aren't thinking about, they really affect how you think. There are a million little things we are programmed with from the time we're born, and they supercede any rational thought. It's how you get a smart, typically rational engineer like James Damore writing treatises on eugenic-based, hateful, incredibly stupid and irrational beliefs about how women are inferior to men -- in a field largely dominated in its inception by women. 

And again, I am biased. Esposito's style just gels with my sensibilities, and I loved TAKE MY WIFE so there's so much goodwill there I can't pretend to be completely objective. 

But I hope some dudes here who disagree with me read this and really think about why they dislike Esposito. If maybe their gut reaction is ""ugh, something about this feels wrong"", if really they had to sum up their feelings it would be ""she just bothers me."" Literally the last thing any cishet white guy should do is trust your gut. Your ""gut"" is a product of a million little programming decisions that an oppressive, patriarchal society made for you, and it largely should not be trusted when it comes to how you think and feel about women.

Whew, this went WAY longer than I expected, but I hope some people get some value out of it.

1. UCBNY is just this hyper sad high school that has less to do with gender and more to do with who you're in classes with. Magnet is the same way. It's like a cultish proving ground based on dedication to the school. It just shows me how petty the comedy world is. 

2. You wrote a lot about like, physical and auditory reasons why men wouldn't like C and R, and while I'm glad you care so deeply about this, I think you're doing an enormous amount of generalizing. Even if I agreed with all of what you said (I agree with some), I would not be comfortable making blanket statements like that about why people do and don't like something subjective, or people in general.

3. I really don't believe anyone needs to be vouched for in comedy like you mention. Tig was and is huge because she's amazing, her albums were beloved, and she was amazingly funny in her podcast for a long time. I'm not going to get super into it, but you must think a lot of men have a chimp like subservience to pack leaders if you honestly believe someone I don't know telling me something is funny is something I need to find something funny. This is Earwolf not a bellator match.

4. In all you wrote, you wrote maybe two sentences about content. You have a multitude of reasons for why someone could just write them off point blank without exploring the very simple idea that I stated earlier. They're not improvisers and they keep coming back on an improv show and don't make memorable episodes. If they were one and done, no one would care at all. It doesn't matter what the content of their stand up is, and what they sound like, or look like, or what their sexuality is if they don't improvise well-- and they typically don't. Earwolf is unique to comedy because it's almost exclusively a place for nonsense.  If you don't engage well with nonsense nothing else matters.

Things either are or aren't funny. Comedy isn't empirically measurable as you seem to think that it is. 
You should learn how quotation marks work and what they signify. (Hint: It isn't what you wish the other person had said so that your argument is strengthened).

That's not whats going on. You're suggesting that the people here who dislike her are in some way bigoted, hate women, blah blah blah, etc. 

If you really believed what you said re: comedy being subjective, you wouldn't be attacking people for finding her excruciatingly unfunny. What you're really saying is that you're right and everyone else is wrong. Which is fine, but don't act like that's not what you're doing.

Again, I accept that some people genuinely do not find them funny, you are making this about you unsurprisingly, I feel there is inherent sexism and homophobia in the world of comedy and rather than try to argue with me on that point you have moved the issue onto ""wah wah, don't call us all sexist"".

I would obviously miss it a lot, but at the same time, I'm looking at my podcast app of choice and I have like a dozen episodes from this past year sitting there that I never got around to listening. If I'm being honest, it's no longer the first thing I listen to on Monday mornings (that honour usually goes to the Player's Club NNF episode), and if the guests aren't super interesting to me I might only listen to it later in the week if at all. I think I've reached a point where the show is kind of stale, if it isn't one of my top dozen or so faves on it or a really good get for the main celebrity guest, I'm not as enthused anymore. I wouldn't be against the show at least seeing some sort of massive overhaul, or maybe going on a lighter schedule or something. If Scott feels the show is creatively limiting to him then he should definitely find a way to change that, even if it would have to be an extreme solution.","Best of 2017 Pt. 4, episode #BO2017.4 of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast on Earwolf",,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/best-of-2017-pt-4/,earwolf.com,http://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/7o1tf8/best_of_2017_pt_4_episode_bo20174_of_comedy_bang/?ref=search_posts
