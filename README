Comedy Bang Bang is an alt-comedy improv podcast published at least weekly since 2009. Each episode features one or more guests, who may be playing themselves or an improvised character. Since its inception, there have been 556 episodes with 432 unique guests.


At the end of the year, listeners vote on the best episodes of the year (Thanksgiving-to-Thanksgiving), which are compiled in year-end Best Of episodes that are published over the Christmas-New Year break. Paul F. Tompkins, the most frequent CBB guest, typically cohosts these shows with the show's host, Scott Aukerman.


This year, there was a lot of Scott-and-Paul talk in the Best Ofs about the frequency in which Paul appears in Best Of'd episodes, I decided to test whether this was because Paul makes episodes good, or it he's just in a lot of episodes. To do this, I used the statistical computing package R, alongside the tidyverse and rvest packages.

I scraped the data directly from the Earwolf website using the cbb-scrape-earwolf.R script, and then performed the data treatment using the cbb-treatment.R script.
