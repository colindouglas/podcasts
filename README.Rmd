Comedy Bang Bang is an alt-comedy improv podcast published at least weekly since 2009. Each episode features one or more guests, who may be playing themselves or an improvised character. As of `r Sys.Date()`, there have been `r nrow(cbb)` mainline episodes with `r length(unique(all_guests))` unique guests.

At the end of the year, listeners vote on the best episodes of the year (Thanksgiving-to-Thanksgiving), which are compiled in year-end Best Of episodes that are published over the Christmas-New Year break. Paul F. Tompkins, the most frequent CBB guest, typically cohosts these shows with the show's host, Scott Aukerman.

In 2017, there was a lot of Scott-and-Paul talk in the Best Ofs about the frequency in which Paul appears in Best Of'd episodes, I wanted to visualize the data to see whether this was because Paul makes episodes good, or it he's just in a lot of episodes. To do this, I scraped the data directly from the Earwolf website using the `scrape-earwolf.R`, and then created the image via `cbb-bestof-figure.R`.
