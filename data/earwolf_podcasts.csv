Her first book titled “The New Welfare Bureaucrats: Entanglements of Race, Class, and Policy Reform” and most recent release “Remaking a Life: How Women Living with HIV/AIDS Confront Inequality” bring to light the uncomfortable fact that racism is still disproportionately affecting people of color in many ways. In the fall of 2019 Jonathan released his book “Over The Top” where he disclosed his HIV positive status which prompted Dr. Watkins-Hayes to write an op-ed on the subject in the NY Times. This inspired the two of them to get together to discuss issues they are both passionate about.

How Did This Get Made?,150.1,Bonus: Director Brian Taylor,2016-12-06,2016-12-04T00:29:10Z,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/bonus-director-brian-taylor/,"No matter how you feel about the films of Brian Taylor—a high-voltage assortment that includes Crank, Gamer and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance—they all, at first glance, inspire a shared singular question: how the fuck did this get made? 
 
Seriously. Just look at what these movies are about: 
To avoid dying, a British hitman must keep adrenaline coursing through his body.   
In a future where kids can control humans as if they were videogame characters, a wrongly imprisoned death row convict seeks freedom.
Years after making a deal with the Devil, a hell-on-wheels monster known as “The Ghost Rider” must save a young boy (and, ultimately, the world).
To many, these films are considered “guilty pleasures.” Yet interestingly enough, they come from an unexpectedly honest place; a desire to provide viewers with an alternative to the four-quadrant, check-the-boxes, CGI-everything Hollywood Machine. 
 
This underlying, upend-the-system ethos was just one the many things I learned during my conversation with Taylor. But by no means was it the most interesting. Not compared to hearing about his wild and crazy “maniac” days, the strange legacy of Gamer and what it’s really like to work with the iconic and eccentric enigma that is Nicolas Cage.

We’re not being tongue-and-cheek about the “bad” part either — speed-bumps kill eighty-five people for every life they save and, seriously, have you ever watched Jay Leno?

It sounds like something a lunatic would shout at you from a bus stop, but it actually happened while FDR was President. And did you hear about the time the U.S. Air Force bombed San Francisco with viruses just to see what would happen?

On this podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien, Dan O’Brien and Soren Bowie figure out how all these failures might have succeeded. Maybe ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ would have worked if Tom Hardy had been the Moriarty to Batman’s Holmes, rather than another problem for Bruce Wayne to punch away.

But now the Internet has changed, and memes aren’t what they once were. Cracked Editors Jack O’Brien, Soren Bowie and Cody Johnston explain how our tubes got clogged with memes, leading to planking, Tebowing and all sorts of other “memes” that spread purely because people wanted to see their faces on the news.
 
We like to think of memes as one way people change the face of the Internet, but some memes change people. No one felt like “information wants to be free” until the Internet made it possible.

It may be that we aren’t all even living in the same nation.

Cell phones made that same journey in just seven years, and smartphones bridged the gap from frivolous to ubiquitous in five. You’re probably familiar with the concept of a ‘tipping point,’ but have you ever wondered why things tip faster nowadays? Babe Ruth’s home run record took 34 years to beat. Mark McGwire’s took just three. It’s because tipping has turned into big business. Jaegermeister and Grey Goose were turned into frat boy icons by the same marketing genius, and Starbucks didn’t succeed because they had the best coffee. They won because they figured out how to make paying lots of money for coffee cool.

Brazil’s preparing for the upcoming World Cup by outfitting their police with Darth Vader armor. Russia used the Sochi Olympics as an excuse to “disappear” protesters. People like to treat sporting events as either wonderful expressions of our competitive spirit or pointless jockery, but really, these giant contests are how we burn off the energy we used to use fighting wars.
 
In today’s podcast, Jack O’Brien and Alex Schmidt talk about Brazil’s upcoming disastrous World Cup, and how soccer games routinely push millions of citizens to riot in the streets. Holding huge games like the Olympics is terrible for cities: Just ask Toronto or Athens about their rotting stadiums. Brazil expects to spend $11.5 billion prepping for the World Cup, to earn maybe $3.5 billion for their trouble. Why would the government agree to that, especially when the money dump was guaranteed to inspire rioting in the streets? Could it be that we need spectacles like this to make up for our recent lack of world wars? Throw on your headphones and click play above.

Whether you try Weight Watchers, Atkins, or whatever fad diet is popular this week, they all have the same efficacy five years down the line. We love blaming fat people for their weight problems, but the truth is that one of the largest industries in this country has spent decades figuring out how to turn wood (yes, wood) and chemicals into perfectly addictive foods you just can’t give up.
 
On today’s podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien and David Wong talk about how our nation’s diet got this bad (hint: the USDA spends more money pushing cheese than healthy habits), and how the same corporations who hacked our waistlines into obesity are working to export the same bad habits across the developing world.

Peeing forms a major plot point in like, half of Tom Hanks’ films. Tom Cruise can’t finish a film without breaking into a dead sprint. And, on the opposite side of things, some actors just never fit in certain roles: Michael Douglas only works as a modern man, John Hamm only works if the film is set in the past, and no audience on earth believes Tom Cruise as a father.
On today’s podcast Cracked editors Jack O’Brien, Michael Swaim and Soren Bowie talk about the weird trends in our favorite actor’s histories. Ever notice how the stakes rise from film to film for Mel Gibson — from saving Scotland in ‘Braveheart’ to saving America in ‘The Patriot’ to saving the world in ‘Signs’)?

It seems inconceivable — just as crazy as that pristine, perfect image of the 1950s so many old white people seem to believe in. Or, the memory millions of Americans have of watching the Challenger explode on TV (even though most of their classrooms didn’t have TVs). It’s not because MJ, those elderly folks and everyone who attended grade school in the 80s are liars. It’s because the human memory is fucking awful, and our brains actively make up shit based on things we hear or decide after-the-fact. On today’s podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien and Jason Pargin talk about the “filter” in our brains that makes us remember everything the wrong way.
 
There’s a reason most fatal accidents happen close to home: your eyes aren’t windows to the world. They’re crafting a picture of reality based on what you’ve seen before and what you expect. History isn’t as much a list of ‘what happened’ as it is a collection of lies and misperceptions a bunch of people have passed down over time. Remember Tom Cruise running out on stage and jumping on Oprah’s couch like a crazy man? No you don’t, because that’s not at all how the actual interview went down! We just want to believe he’s crazy hard enough that we invented a lunatic episode for the man. Remember seeing that first plane hit the tower on 9/11? No you don’t, because that first impact wasn’t recorded on television. Your brain is lying to you, and if you click play you’ll learn exactly how.",Jason Pargin

You’ve got Game of Thrones, where every likable character dies horribly and sociopathy is cruise control for success. There’s True Detective, a show were any given screengrab would fit in the dictionary alongside the definition of “bleak”. Hell, the critically-acclaimed series with the happiest ending we’ve seen recently was Breaking Bad. What does that say about us?
 
Cracked editors Jack O’Brien, Dan O’Brien and Michael Swaim asked this question on today’s podcast. Whether you’re looking at television or movies, soul-crushing sadness seems to be the new norm. Your show just won’t draw in a modern audience unless it’s got an antihero. Has something shifted in our culture? Can we blame this on 9/11? Or, has the darkness we used to put in our novels and saddest music just finally bled out into film and TV?

We usually think of genius as one explicit thing: You’re a genius at music, or computer programming, or whatever. But there’s no straight road from “genius” to “what you do with that genius.” Charles Darwin may have figured out evolution as a side effect of his obsession with eating rare animals. Paris Hilton seems like she’s famous for being rich and spoiled, but she might be the greatest marketing mind of our generation.

It’s not because they’re all so much better at living than we are — it’s because we want to believe the path to success starts by asking “how” rather than just nutting up and starting. On today’s podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien and Jason Pargin discuss the myths we build around self-improvement. Diets focus on cutting carbs or sugar or fat, while all that really matters is being willing to sacrifice the part of yourself that loves eating to build a new person who loves being skinny. The method doesn’t matter as much as the resolve to start doing something.
 
Some cultures have no future tense in their languages. You’d think that might be a handicap, but people who use languages like English, with a future tense, are more likely to be obese slackers who wind up in debt. It seems insane, but the weird fact is our brains perceive future-us as a different person than now-us. That’s why you’ll eat a whole carton of ice cream at midnight, because obesity and diabetes aren’t YOUR problem. They’re some future asshole’s problem, and screw that guy.
 
See? Our brains are programmed to betray us. And media that shows off the absurd lifestyles of the wealthy and famous don’t help matters. Rather than focusing on our actual options and the paths to success that are really open to us, we look at Kim Kardashian and secretly set ‘born into wealth and celebrity’ as our unstated, unachievable life goal.

Or that the concept of “nuclear winter” was a load of B.S. invented by the KGB? Or that Diane Lane had to read the ‘Man of Steel’ script in extreme confidentiality, even though it’s basically the worst movie of the last ten years? The world is full of secrets — in a way that’s deeply creepy and probably counterproductive. And, on today’s podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien, Daniel O’Brien and Soren Bowie bring together as many of those secrets as they can to see if they aren’t all a little ridiculous.
 
In fact, there are so many secrets in this episode that there’s a whole ‘nother person providing extra ones. “Mike” is a U.S. border agent and former undercover operative working against Mexico’s drug cartels. He (OR SHE????) was featured on the site before in a hit personal experience article (read it here: www.cracked.com/article_21257_5-i…rcover-agent.html) and on the podcast they go further into exactly how sneaky they needed to be in the shady, terrifying world of battling drug runners, human traffickers and more.
 
From there, we pick apart the biggest secrets of our time — why do only two people get to know the recipes for KFC and Coke?

Think about it: from Harry Potter to Luke Skywalker, orphans make up a dominant percentage of the heroic population. There’s something about dead parents that can make any character into an instant underdog. Even Superman, literal god-being, turns into someone we can root for when you remove his mom and dad (and also obliterate his homeworld via supernova), and the same is true of billionaire crazy-person Bruce Wayne. Why does this trend exist, and just what does it say about us?
 
On today’s Cracked podcast, editors Jack O’Brien, Michael Swaim and Jason Pargin (David Wong) sit down to hash out just why this is. Whether it’s Guardians of the Galaxy’s Peter Quill, or Captain Kirk in the new Star Trek reboot, you can’t be a hero if you’ve got a living mom and dad.

After choosing your door, the host shows you one of the doors the car is NOT behind and asks if you’d like to change your pick to the only other remaining door. What do you do?
 
Common sense would prove that the host removing a door from contention has no effect. You had a 33% chance of winning a car and now you have a 50% chance. But what if we told you, by switching your decision, your chances of winning a car would go up to 66%? You would tell us to take high school statistics over again, but you’d be wrong.
 
Today on the podcast Jack O’Brien, Dan O’Brien, and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss some of the more deceiving statistics in our world that prove that common sense is worthless and our brains are horrible at math.

The Cracked Podcast,48,Plot Holes in Great Movies LIVE!,2014-09-29,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/plot-holes-in-great-movies-live/,"Hollywood’s villains are the luckiest people on the damn planet. Let’s talk about climactic midpoint of The Dark Knight: The Joker stages an assassination attempt forcing Batman, but not actually Batman, to reveal his true identity just for the purpose of getting caught later, then forcing Batman Batman to choose between Rachel and Harvey Dent, who are rigged to perfectly timed bombs in warehouses somehow 20 minutes away from any police presence.
 
How in the world did he plan all of that by himself and know it would all be timed perfectly!? What are all of the steps that the Joker would have to go through to ensure all of these events happened with Swiss precision? The weirdness goes beyond intelligent villains. How does the asteroid in Armageddon know to target our most famous buildings? In Friday the 13th, Part 2, how the hell did Jason Voorhees track down his victim’s house without a map, or a goddamn car?
 
This week, on a very special LIVE podcast from Zanies in Nashville, Cracked’s Jack O’Brien, Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), Michael Swaim, Soren Bowie, and Cody Johnson are joined by the Cinema Sins guys (Jeremy Scott and Chris Atkinson) to discuss some major plot holes from their favorite blockbuster movies.",""
The Cracked Podcast,49,How One Logical Fallacy Keeps Making You Wrong,2014-10-06,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-one-logical-fallacy-keeps-making-you-wrong/,"You may be the first to admit that your Facebook page is simply a highlight reel of your life — a carefully collected stream of only the best pictures, moments, and one-liners — but why is it hard to make that same realization about the lives of everyone else? Why do we assume Japan is a nuthouse of tentacle porn and horrifying game shows, even though all the weird American porn and TV doesn’t make our nation a typhoon of madness?
 
That’s sampling bias, homies! The same way the local news only reports the one study that “proves” Aspartame causes cancer but ignores all of the studies that say it doesn’t. Our brain does this to us all day. Other people’s brains do it to us, too. If you think Russia is basically ‘Mad Max’ with Snow, 24/7, it’s because your picture of Russia comes from the craziest dash-cam videos a few Russians managed to upload.
 
On today’s podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien, Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), and Alex Schmidt sit down for a podcast about the unexpected sampling errors that populate our life.

The Cracked Podcast,50,Babies: Cuddly Idiots or Evil Super-Geniuses?,2014-10-13,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/babies-cuddly-idiots-or-evil-super-geniuses/,"We love babies, and we’re also horrified by all that they imply. Babies can’t eat on their own or hold their heads up, and they go to the bathroom in their pants like drunken little monsters. But science is beginning to show that there may be a lot more going on in their heads than we had previously thought. Scientists have found that babies are surprisingly good at emotional manipulation. Even more frightening,they’ve found evidence of racism in babies. It gets crazier: the very scent of a baby is a powerful drug with mind-altering effects on their parent’s brains.
 
In a live taping at the LA Podfest, Cracked writers Jack O’Brien, Dan O’Brien, Soren Bowie and Michael Swaim discuss the weird things we don’t know about the psychology and physiology of babies. Did you know babies have extra bones? Or that babies from different countries cry in different languages?

The Cracked Podcast,51,The Economics of Brainwashing,2014-10-27,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-economics-of-brainwashing/,"We all have addicts in our lives — that friend or relative who fell prey to alcohol, heroin or some other drug. Nobody pretends those aren’t “real” addictions. But when a D-list reality star checks in to rehab for porn addiction or a major study warns of smartphone addiction, we roll our eyes. If an obese person claims they’re addicted to eating, we tsk their lack of self-control.
 
Why isn’t every addiction created equal in the court of public opinion? Compulsive smartphone use doesn’t have the same consequences as smoking crack, but ‘Candy Crush’ still makes use of the same addictive feedback loop. Whether you’re gambling or eating Cheetos, you’re trading your time and money in exchange for regular hits of dopamine.
 
This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss the science and culture of addiction in the 21st century. They’ll look at all the ways giant corporations are exploiting our brains to control our behavior — and ask if there’s any way this addiction train can be stopped.",Jason Pargin
The Cracked Podcast,52,Insane Deleted Scenes from History,2014-11-03,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/insane-deleted-scenes-from-history/,"‘Historical fiction’ is almost always more of the latter than the former: so much history just doesn’t look very interesting onscreen. But our passion for only the screen-friendly bits of the past means we often wind up with a much more boring and less accurate mental image of historic events.
 
Any WWII film set in Germany paints all the people as part of a hive mind set on world domination. But what if we told you the National Socialist Party never won a single election with more than 42% of the vote? The real Nazi party was much smaller than we tend to remember — but it was also way crazier. From Hitler’s nerdy obsession with fantasy books to Himmler’s attempts to resurrect the dead, the Third Reich was much LARP-ier than you’ve been lead to expect.
 
This week, Jack O’Brien, Soren Bowie, Michael Swaim, Robert Evans and JF Sargent talk about the flip sides to well-known historic moments that Hollywood left out.
 
We’ll also talk about ‘Little House on the Prairie’, the TV show and set of children books about a little family that could out on the American frontier. The one thing Laura Ingalls Wilder left out is that her next door neighbors at the time were a family of crazed cannibal serial killers.

The Cracked Podcast,53,Decisions Your Brain Makes Behind Your Back,2014-11-10,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/decisions-your-brain-makes-behind-your-back/,"Hollywood never fails to remind us that we only use 10% of our brains. That statistic is bullshit, but it’s true that around 90% of the activity in our brains is completely unconscious. We make most of our decisions without even knowing it. Our brains are constantly making decisions for us before we even know it, and it’s our conscious mind that fills in the rest of the details, crafting this decision into a narrative. That’s how a guy like Dennis Rodman could know where every ball was going to go as soon as it left a player’s hand — it’s also how most racism happens, and the reason why “when the judge ate last” is the best predictor of how he’ll rule.
 
This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss the conscious and unconscious sides of human decision-making, how they’re tied together, and the unexpected biases they produce. They’ll also talk with writer and improvisational comedian Ali Farahnakian to learn how these theories can be applied to comedy.
 
Listen now to get some solid advice on improvisational humor — and to learn why your political preferences might be less the result of your own decisions than of how your brain is hardwired.",Jason Pargin
The Cracked Podcast,54,How a Dating Site Proved Society Is Doomed,2014-11-17,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-a-dating-site-proved-society-is-doomed/,"When the founders of OkCupid started one of the most popular dating sites on the Internet, they didn’t intend to find out all of humanity’s deep, dark secrets. All they wanted was to help people make babies. However, they accidentally ended up with a treasure trove of information about the difference between what people say (and even think) about themselves and what they actually do – and you won’t like it.
 
By analyzing the language and behavior of OkCupid users, they’ve determined that you’re probably a lot more racist than you think, and you can actually guess someone’s race with a stunning degree of accuracy based on what they care about. (It involves lumberjack music festivals.) You’re also probably a lot gayer, unless you actually label yourself as bisexual. The Internet as a whole is rife with this data -– you can even track the voting results for the 2008 election by mapping which areas of the country Googled racist jokes. But you shouldn’t be afraid of leaving these trails of data, because it means that in the future, history will no longer be written by the winners, and every one of us is a potential Anne Frank.
 
This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien, Michael Swaim and Alex Schmidt are joined by one of the cofounders of OkCupid, Christian Rudder, to discuss his recent book, Dataclysm, and how the 21st century will be defined by the enormous amounts of data that can be found by digging through your virtual trash.",""
The Cracked Podcast,55,Why Hollywood Always Gets the Apocalypse Wrong,2014-12-01,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-hollywood-always-gets-the-apocalypse-wrong/,"Lately, you can’t swing an undead cat without hitting the end of the world. Whether it’s the pure escapism of ‘The Walking Dead’ or high art like ‘The Road’, every story hits the same beats: it’s every man for himself against the hoard of zombies or cannibals or nuclear Nazi mutants, and the only ones who survive are the badasses with shotguns willing to shoot their best friends for a Pop Tart. Even your general post-apocalyptic dystopia movies fall in the same lazy traps — every city looks like a warehouse or a desert, not because it’s an accurate depiction of such a society, but because they’re cheaper to film in.
 
But whether it’s a case of art reflecting society or storytellers accidentally tapping into a human desire — and running with it until it’s as bloated and decayed as their crew of extras — it says something about us that’s pretty uncomfortable to think about. The apocalypse is just the new Old West, but instead of conquering the “savages,” we just revel in being way better at savagery. We like the idea of the fall of civilization because it allows us to elevate basic human decency to heroic decency, and escape the complications of the modern world — even if most of us would die without it. But that’s why every disaster in the history of ever has shown that it doesn’t play out that way at all.
 
This week, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien, Soren Bowie, and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss the rote ways in which apocalypse movies and TV shows always get the demise of civilization wrong.","Soren Bowie, Jason Pargin"
The Cracked Podcast,56,People With Impossible Superpowers,2014-12-08,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/people-with-impossible-superpowers/,"What if Tony Stark built humanitarian robots out of super cheap materials and not a weaponized fleet of mech suits? What if someone could run as far and as infinitely as Barry Allen but at a more human speed? What if you found out that an American president reached power using Charles Xavier-like powers of persuasion. It sounds like a made up version of the Marvel extended universe — yes, the Flash is a DC property, but just go with it — but these are actual, recorded talents that you NEVER hear about.
 
Recorded at the Comikaze Expo in Los Angeles, Cracked Podcast co-hosts Jack O’Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Soren Bowie, Adam Tod Brown, Tom Reimann, Dan O’Brien, and Alex Schmidt for a panel about insane real-life powers the world should know more about, then take questions from the audience.",""
The Cracked Podcast,57,How the PG-13 Rating Took Over the World,2014-12-15,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-the-pg-13-rating-took-over-the-world/,"No matter how cool, young or hip you are, eventually the world of mass media will leave your increasingly-saggy ass behind. Recently, the YouTube channel of PewDiePie, a Swedish video game commenter, became the most viewed YouTube channel in history with over 6.6 billion views. The Wall Street Journal cites that PewDiePie makes around $4 million a year from ads sold on his YouTube account. In the Cracked offices, this feat was met with responses like, “what the hell is PewDiePie,” “I’ve lost faith in society,” and, “I have no idea what any of those words mean.” We’re old — not ‘discounts at The Sizzler’ old, but old enough that we’re no longer the gatekeepers of popular culture.
Tragically (for us) and normally (for everyone else), pop culture is moving faster than ever: YouTubers are making millions; things that some of us were too old for originally, like Power Rangers, are being rebooted; and 13-year-olds seem to have legitimate grounds to bemoan “kids these days.”
This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien, Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), Soren Bowie, and Tom Reimann discuss the specific areas of pop culture that seem to have left them behind.

You can’t reach January 1st without learning every hack writer’s opinion of the best movies, albums, and TV shows from the last 12 months. 
Experiment time: Google a list of the top 10 films from 2004. You either wont recognize half of movies, or you’ll find yourself wondering what drugs the writer was on to include “Mr. 3000” and leave out “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.”
We are terrible at perspective. Things like the Ebola scare or the Sony hack seem nightmarish in their moment, but they fade to the back of our minds as soon as the next awful thing comes about. The fact that next year’s Exploding Testicle Flu and Bill Murray email hack will both be much more shocking won’t stop either of these from making it into the top ten most important stories this year. If there’s one thing new media excels at, it’s turning molehills into goddamn Matterhorns.",""
The Cracked Podcast,59,Best and Worst Fictional Places to Work,2015-01-05,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/best-and-worst-fictional-places-to-work/,"If you had to guess what the average Death Star employee was like, and you could only watch the ‘Star Wars’ movies, you’d assume it was filled with only two types of people: stormtroopers, and old British men in small hats. Where are the engineers, the janitors, the scientists, the cooks, and the thousands of other people required to maintain a station the size of a moon? And if these people exist, they surely must be paid well considering the risk of going to a workplace so frequently destroyed by rebels.
Countless evil organizations from LexCorp to Cobra to the Foot Clan must secretly be great employers to attract a never-ending supply of employees ready to do their bidding.
On this week’s live podcast from the Comikaze Expo, the cast and writers of After Hours (Jack O’Brien, Michael Swaim, Soren Bowie, Dan O’Brien, Katie Willert, and Cody Johnston) brainstorm and take audience suggestions for an upcoming episode of the show.

The Cracked Podcast,60,Mind Blowing Movie Thought Experiments,2015-01-12,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/mind-blowing-movie-thought-experiments/,"Last year, Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’ took advantage of some of the most up-to-date quantum theory we’ve got, and wove in a story about space travel, time, and relativity. 
While that movie went out of its way to include actual science, others just happen upon quantum theory accidentally. Take ‘The Empire Strikes Back’– Luke trains with Yoda for what seems like months in the entire time it takes Han to get through one warp-speed chase. Some might call it a plot hole, but actually could the better explanation be that Luke and Yoda were on a planet that experienced time differently?
This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O’Brien, Michael Swaim, and Soren Bowie explain in layman’s terms some of the basic paradoxes and thought experiments that have come to define quantum theory, and then apply quantum physics to popular movie plot holes.",Soren Bowie
The Cracked Podcast,61,The Year in Movies (2015),2015-01-19,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-year-in-movies-2015/,"In the last two weeks, the internet was blessed with new trailers for both ‘Ant-Man’ and ‘Avengers: Age of Ultron’. Frames were analyzed, Hulks were busted, and lids were flipped. For millions of people, no international tragedies or disasters could compare with the latest news from Marvel’s explosion-dense Verse. And we’re not even getting into the shrieking excitement that already surrounds the latest Star Wars movie.
As crazy as it seems, reports indicate that there are perhaps hundreds of movies coming out this year that don’t feature Stan Lee cameos or Jedi. Perhaps this year’s ‘Edge of Tomorrow’ is hiding somewhere and we can’t see it through the fog of discussion surrounding hilted lightsabers. The big blockbusters of the year have a way of drowning out everything else, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t filmmakers doing some seriously cool things in 2015.
This week, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien is joined by Alisha Grauso from Moviepilot.com, Drew McWeeny from HitFix.com, and Scott Mendelson from Forbes.com to discuss some of the box office and filmmaking trends that we’re moving towards in 2015. They’ll cover the year’s most anticipated movies that AREN’T sequels or comic book movies, and that don’t involve so much as a single dinosaur. Crazy, we know.",Drew McWeeny
The Cracked Podcast,62,How Internet Subcultures Combat Free Speech,2015-02-02,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-internet-subcultures-combat-free-speech/,"Here’s the easiest experiment in the world. Go to YouTube. Click on ANY video. Scroll to the comments. How long did it take you to find a comment that was the most horrible and vile combination of words you’ve ever seen? If it took longer than 2 seconds, you really weren’t trying hard enough.
Internet commenters! Trolls! Gross men’s rights groups! Your weird aunt on Facebook who doesn’t think the moon landing happened! You don’t know a single one of these people in real life (other than your aunt) but they seem to make up 75% of the population whenever you go onto the internet. How does that happen? What has made the internet, the ultimate technology to make speech truly free, into this school-yard full of bullies and uninformed people shouting into empty rooms?
This week on the podcast, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien is joined by editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Tom Reimann to try and answer these questions. They theorize on why the loudest people on the internet are so over-represented, and how the un-moderated nature of the internet and social media might be limiting free speech more than we even realize.","Jason Pargin, Tom Reimann"
The Cracked Podcast,63,"Tiny Cause, Huge Effect",2015-02-09,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/tiny-cause-huge-effect/,"We’ve all heard about the butterfly effect: a butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world, and weeks later that results in a hurricane somewhere else. But that doesn’t actually happen, right?
We can’t prove that a butterfly can affect the weather, but we certainly can tell you that the weather affects us in huge ways. It’s been proven that sunny weather yields a good day for the stock market, and that a rainy election day typically results in a Republican win. So maybe that imaginary butterfly has a bigger grasp on our lives than we think.
This week on the podcast, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien is joined by Michael Swaim and Dan O’Brien to discuss some examples of this very phenomenon and show how the tiniest of mistakes can change the course of history.","Daniel O'Brien, Michael Swaim"
The Cracked Podcast,64,Insane Internet Fan Theories,2015-02-16,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/insane-internet-fan-theories/,"As we’ve previously covered on the site, before JK Rowling had even finished the ‘Harry Potter’ books, an interesting fan theory started popping up on Potterverse fansites. The speculation went that perhaps the chosen one wasn’t our boy Harry, but actually lovable dunce Neville Longbottom, and that all the whole ‘Harry is chosen one’ nonsense was Dumbledore intentionally misdirecting he-who-shall-not-be-typed.
Whether or not Rowling had planned this, we all know what we got in the end: another textbook hero’s journey that would’ve made Joseph Campbell proud. But isn’t that first theory a lot cooler? We think so.
Outside-of-the-box fan theories like this are what we’re discussing on the podcast this week. We cover a range of pop culture from movie franchises like ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Harry Potter’ to the indelible black mark on the internet: Rebecca Black’s ‘Friday.’ Recorded live at the San Diego Comedy Festival, cohosts Jack O’Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Soren Bowie, Adam Tod Brown, Cody Johnston, Dan O’Brien, and Alex Schmidt.","Cody Johnston, Daniel O'Brien, Soren Bowie"

Movies get money wrong too. Why does every post-apocalypse just look like a dirty Los Angeles when the present-day hovels in India, China, and Brazil seem much worse?

The Cracked Podcast,66,Cracks in Human Perception,2015-03-09,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/cracks-in-human-perception/,"We know it’s old news already, but last week when that blue/black/white/gold dress tore the internet and countless marriages apart, it brought up a theme that we like to talk about a lot at Cracked: how our senses are about as trustworthy as Brian Williams’ war memoirs.
No, it’s true. We’ve even covered on the podcast before that your brain has as many nerves feeding information out to your eyes as your eyes have feeding information back. In other words, a lot of what you rely on as your vision is really just your brain filling in gaps because it’s too lazy to do the rest of the work.
Co-hosts Jack O’Brien and Michael Swaim are joined this week by executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), and use the frenzy over ‘the dress’ to dive into a conversation about perception, consciousness and the harm of saying, “I’ll believe it when I see it.”",Jason Pargin
The Cracked Podcast,67,Why Celebrities Go Crazy,2015-03-16,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-celebrities-go-crazy/,"Here are two scenarios that might properly contextualize Harrison Ford in light of his recent plane crash into a Santa Monica golf course:
One. He’s Hollywood’s Mr. Magoo: a hapless, sensory-challenged old man who creates a chain reaction of havoc and destruction with every misplaced step he takes.
Two. He’s Wile E. Coyote. His dream job is actually to be a pilot, so he chases that dream (Road Runner) at every chance he gets, using exceedingly shoddy 1940s era machinery and avionics, only to wind up, yet again, in a full-body cast.
Do we know anything about Harrison Ford or what drives him? No. Does Harrison Ford listen to podcasts? Probably not. Has he torn his ACL twice while acting? You bet he has. And that’s all we need for this week’s episode, wherein Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien is joined by Soren Bowie and Kristi Harrison to talk about some celebrity pet theories that explain their lunatic behavior.
They discuss Harrison Ford’s aforementioned plane crash and how it relates to Bruce Willis’ strange music career, how Garth Brooks is either the world’s greatest diva or the universe’s least humanoid space alien, and then discuss theories on the deaths of Whitney Houston and Elvis Presley.","Kristi Harrison, Soren Bowie"
The Cracked Podcast,68,Why Documentaries Lie,2015-03-30,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-documentaries-lie/,"Anthropomorphic goatee and director of ‘The Jinx’ Andrew Jarecki has recently taken criticism from many sides regarding the ending of his documentary series. Some condemn the way he sat on critical evidence and withheld it from the police, while others criticize how he inserts himself into the story of ‘The Jinx’ and how its final episode fraudulently plays with chronology. But if Robert Durst goes to prison, do the ends justify the means?
Other popular documentaries have an even less legitimate relationship with the truth. Morgan Spurlock’s results from ‘Super Size Me’ haven’t been able to be replicated; ‘Searching for Sugarman’ conveniently leaves out that Rodriguez knew he was world famous in a number of other countries; and ‘Fahrenheit 9/11’ is basically pure propaganda, yet their entertainment value is undeniable and carries weight despite these criticisms.
This week on the podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Josh Sargent to talk about the recent documentary boom and some of the genre’s most popular entries from the last 10 years. They have a spoiler-filled discussion about ‘Serial’ and ‘The Jinx’, talk through the tricks documentarians use to manipulate truth, and whether their ultimate obligation should be to honesty or entertainment.",Jason Pargin
The Cracked Podcast,69,True Stories That Make Movies Better,2015-04-06,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/true-stories-that-make-movies-better/,"Pop quiz, hotshot. Did you know that ‘Speed’, the Keanu-on-a-bus 90s action tent-pole was originally developed as a completely different film? At first, the script was written as an ensemble drama about a cast of strangers on a bus working together to stop a terrorist, but once Keanu signed on, it was rewritten as the fast and dumb classic we know and love today.
So many huge Hollywood films have little-known stories like these, where one decision changes the entire film and the lives of everyone involved. In other cases, these stories don’t provide an alternate history as much as they provide a new context that makes re-watching the film a completely different experience.
This week on the podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Earwolf’s Matt Gourley to discuss some of the stories unearthed from his podcast ‘I Was There Too’ and then chats with Cracked editor David Christopher Bell about overlooked behind the scenes stories from the films of David O. Russell, Stanley Kubrick and more.",

Case in point: the Sony email hack revealed the studio didn’t pursue a sequel to the Denzel Washington film ‘The Equalizer’ because “the international motion picture audience is racist.” No, not America, we solved that whole racism thing, it’s the rest of the world that’s racist.
Look at the triumph of new network shows like ‘Empire’ and ‘Black-ish.’ The media decries their success as random or flukey when actually there’s a much simpler and less demeaning explanation for their accomplishments: people want to watch shows about the African-American experience and it’s a market that’s vastly under-served.
This week on the podcast, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien sits down for 3 conversations about the racist stuff in pop-culture that white people just don’t see. First, he is joined by Kevin Avery of ‘Last Week Tonight’ and ‘Denzel Washington is the Greatest Actor of All Time Period,’ then he hops on the phone with Kid Fury and Crissle West from ‘The Read,’ and wraps up with a conversation with ‘Yo Is This Racist?’ host Andrew Ti.","Kevin  Avery, Andrew Ti"

Look it up. The most overlooked part of the film is when Nikola Tesla (played by Bowie) invents a freaking cloning machine and then sort of disappears because the movie needs to be wrapped up by the two-hour mark.
What happens to Tesla? Where’s the Tesla v. Edison sequel where Tesla is the most powerful man on Earth because he invents cloning in the late-1800s?
This week on the podcast, recorded live at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, Jack O’Brien, Michael Swaim, Dan O’Brien, and Soren Bowie discuss ‘The Prestige,’ ‘Wall-E,’ the ‘Indiana Jones’ franchise and a number of other films with awesome sequels that don’t exist, but should.","Daniel O'Brien, Soren Bowie"

And while he’s now technically retired from his column at the Miami Herald, he still publishes books every year at the same clip.
Now we live in a different world for humor writing. While the best comedians write for television and give away half of their jokes for free on Twitter, Dave is one of the last colossi of a fading art, whose influence on comedy and this very website is unmistakable.
Cracked editors Jack O’Brien and Soren Bowie sit down for a long-form conversation with Dave about his new book, Live Right And Find Happiness (Although Beer is Much Faster), how he managed to find inspiration for his weekly column, the relationship between comedy and free speech, and the irrefutable weirdness of Florida.",Soren Bowie

Within the next 2 years, that number would jump up to 100,000, making it the largest mass-migration in US history. In the early 1920s, the film industry would create a 2nd and more lasting population boom in California, as throngs of hopefuls moved cross-country to become rich and famous movie stars. By 1962, California was the most populous state in the union.
The state now balances on a curious precipice. California produces a majority of the country’s fruits, vegetables and nuts, yet is in the midst of a drought that’s turning one region into a poisonous dust-bowl. The libertarian pot-farmers of the north use 8% of the state’s electricity, yet are trying to secede and form their own state. San Francisco has been entirely taken over by the tech industry’s wealthy and the city’s tradition of taking care of its lowest class is falling by the wayside. Los Angeles has been a smog-riddled nightmare from the fever-dreams of John Carpenter ever since the auto industry deliberately razed the public transportation system. And an Austrian-sounding robot sent from the future to destroy humanity served as governor for 8 years.
This week, we give Florida a break and take a look at the dark history of the Golden State. Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors Dan O’Brien and Robert Evans as they discuss the state’s unexpectedly high murder rate, its burgeoning marijuana industry, and why, since 1848, it’s seduced millions into thinking they can get rich quick.",Daniel O'Brien
The Cracked Podcast,74,The Horrible 90s Hit Song That Explains The Modern World,2015-05-18,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-horrible-90s-hit-song-that-explains-the-modern-world/,"In his new column going up tomorrow, David Wong uses the hilariously outdated Billy Joel song ‘We Didn’t Start The Fire’ to illustrate a confounding problem with dominant white and western culture. The song chronologically lists everything that’s gone wrong in the world from 1949 to 1989 in between choruses of “We didn’t start the fire,” meaning, “Hey, it’s not my fault that the world is so fucked up.”
It’s a common and understandable knee-jerk reaction for people in the 21st century to think that just because they were born in the 1980s, or that their grandparents didn’t come to America until the 20th century, that they’re not responsible for something like slavery. Yes, it’s true that you’re not individually to blame for slavery, but you still may reap countless invisible benefits from being a white male in the 21st century that you just don’t get if you’re African-American, or from a poor family, or a woman. There’s an endless context to complicated social matters that doesn’t just begin or end with, “I didn’t start the fire.”
That was just one example of the ways in which many people are blind to the historical context in which we live–that every moment in the present is either consciously or subconsciously tied to the entire history of our species. This week on the podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by David Wong (aka Jason Pargin) and Josh Sargent to discuss these historical blindspots and how they’re being slowly eroded by the human progress of the last two centuries.",Jason Pargin
The Cracked Podcast,75,Unspoken Stereotypes Movies Trick You Into Believing,2015-06-01,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/unspoken-stereotypes-movies-trick-you-into-believing/,"Source material aside, did you find yourself watching ‘Daredevil’ on Netflix and thinking: Matt Murdock is a very capable blind man in New York, why does he need the cane, the sunglasses, and the wide-eyed stare? He walks the streets with ease and beats up thugs with horrifying proficiency, why the need for the standard film and television signifiers that yes, he is indeed a blind man?
Can’t characters be blind, be handicapped, be gay, be Jamaican, be anything other than straight white American men without writers or directors or costume designers slapping the easiest, most stereotypical labels on them?
This week on the podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Josh Sargent to talk about the pitfalls of this cinematic shorthand, how certain movie stereotypes unknowingly misrepresent the people they try to epitomize, and why even “a good stereotype,” is still wildly reductive of an entire population of people.",Jason Pargin
The Cracked Podcast,76,Weird Ways Repeating Sounds Hack the Human Mind,2015-06-08,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/weird-ways-repeating-sounds-hack-the-human-mind/,"Why is it that if you hear a pop song like “I Kissed A Girl” more than two or three times, you feel like you’re going insane, but when you play an old video game you can listen to the music for hours? Some of the song loops from Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog are only around a minute long, yet they never annoy or distract as you try to finish a level. 
The brain does weird things in response to repetition. As you’ll hear in the episode, a UCSD professor found that if you hear a repeating loop of almost any series of spoken words, your mind will begin to hear that input as music.
This week on the podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors Dan O’Brien and Alex Schmidt to discuss how the human mind seeks out repetition, turns that repetition into music, and how video games have turned this science into an unsung art form.

You could easily guess what movies these were – your X-Men, your Hobbits, your Legos and Transformers – but what was that one outlier, that one movie that didn’t fit the mold of mass-produced comic book movies or animated films? That movie was in fact the highest grossing film  of last year, and it was an adaptation itself, ‘American Sniper.’
As you would assume, ‘American Sniper’ wasn’t the runaway hit overseas as it was in the States, but neither were the rest of the films from the American top 10. Every major foreign market only featured a small handful of American blockbusters in their top 10. The rest of the spots in each country went to smaller adult comedies and dramas, the types of movies we almost never see atop our box office. Why is that, and where are those movies in America? It feels like we’re told in the US that the reason we only have blockbuster movies here is because the rest of the world craves big, American spectacle. Then why does it feel like our main exports are comic book movies that half of the world doesn’t even really want to see?
This week on the podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors David Bell and Josh Sargent to discuss the seeming disparity between the size and the quality of modern-day blockbusters, their effectiveness internationally, and how the process of developing movies has changed over the last hundred years.

We’ll hear in the media proposed solutions to the problem of gun violence in America, and we’ll also hear the realities of why they wont work. We’ll hear about magazine restrictions and closing the gun show loophole, but we’ll also hear about how gun ownership is a tradition and a hobby across America that would be as easy to prohibit tomorrow as it would be to prohibit driving a car or owning a boat.
The gun debate is a nuanced, complex issue with elaborate roots that stretch back generations. This week on the podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Josh Sargent to discuss both sides of the gun debate, the statistics about gun violence that you almost never hear, how the debate is painted by race, how gun ownership is more deeply rooted in a person’s identity than we think, and how trying to predict the next mass shooter will always be impossible.","Jason Pargin, Josh Sargent"
The Cracked Podcast,79,Hidden Rules Behind Famous TV Shows,2015-07-13,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/hidden-rules-behind-famous-tv-shows/,"A frequent topic on this podcast is the way all movies follow the same structure and how our brains are trained to look for these common rules. Whether it’s Die Hard  or Star Wars or The Godfather, all movies follow the same relatively specific beats. If they don’t, we usually end up feeling short shrifted or confused. That’s why a filmmaker like Terrence Malick can be so frustrating to audiences.
But how does this apply to TV, a medium where outside of the half-hour or hour-long time  constraints, a premise could conceivably last for tens or hundreds of hours? How do you maintain and break expectations in a world where the Simpsons need to face a new conflict every week for 30 years? Rules, that’s how!
This week on the podcast, special guest host Dan O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Alex Schmidt to discuss the secret rulebooks that kept the Looney Toons and Community afloat, and how applying strict guidelines to TV shows both maintains their continuity and keeps them watchable.",Soren Bowie
The Cracked Podcast,80,Horrifying Things Implied By Famous Movies,2015-07-20,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/horrifying-things-implied-by-famous-movies/,"Think about every time a movie villain asks the hero something like, “you and what army?” You know what happens next: a door opens, a roof explodes, or the camera pushes out the window to show, you guessed it, our hero’s army. Maybe it’s the rest of the Avengers, maybe an actual army, or maybe just our hero’s muscle.
It’s a clever reveal in the moment, but think about it realistically. Does that mean if Tony Stark is chatting with Loki and that moment is about to happen, are the rest of the Avengers just hiding in a lobby somewhere waiting for their cue? Maybe they’re in a broom closet, ears pressed to the door. What if no one asks, “you and what army?” Is there a contingency plan for dramatically revealing yourself?
Every movie is full of logic gaps like these where, for the sake of time or dramatic tension or comedy, the audience is spared the mundane or absurd reality of a situation.

The Cracked Podcast,81,A Genealogy of Modern Fear,2015-07-27,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/a-genealogy-of-modern-fear/,"If you turn on the TV or scroll through Facebook for any short period of time, it seems like we’re consumed with fear. There’s always a new airborne virus or a new piece of legislature destined to sink the country into Purge-like anarchy, not to mention the sharks, snakes and spiders that have been trying to kill us for millennia.
It’s easy to place the blame on media in the 21st century, but fear mongering is no recent addition to the human experience. You can go back through history and trace all sorts of fears through the written word. Where now our movies depict zombies, alien invasions and nuclear wars, medieval literature spoke of demons, hellfire and apocalypse scenarios more fitting to the times.
This week Jack O’Brien is joined by Kristi Harrison and Michael Swaim to tackle everything related to how we experience fear in the 21st century: what fears we can blame on evolution and what fears we can blame on society, whether it’s true to say we’re more afraid now than ever before and what our most common fears say about us as a species.","Kristi Harrison, Michael Swaim"
The Cracked Podcast,82,Why Getting Away With Murder Is Easier Than You Think,2015-08-10,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-getting-away-with-murder-is-easier-than-you-think/,"Here’s a potentially scary statistic: Of the 330 people freed by the Innocence Project, an organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted prisoners, 10% of them actually admitted to committing the crime they were innocent of. They even estimate that as many as 5% of all prisoners in America are innocent. That may seem like a low percentage, but that’s tens or hundreds of thousands of people in jail right now who committed no crime.
In the age of DNA testing, facial recognition software and the deputization of every person with a smartphone camera and a YouTube account, it’s actually barbaric the ease with which we send people to prison without really knowing for sure if they’re guilty or just had bad lawyers. We like to think that by comparing the technologies we have now to the primitive science and guesswork of 100 years ago that we’re actually really good at solving crimes and putting the real bad guys away, but that’s not the case. DNA science isn’t nearly as exact as we think it is, and the criminal justice system is built more for quickly shuffling suspects to prison than actually solving crimes.
This week on the podcast Jack O’Brien is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to discuss how far we’ve come as a species in the way we try to solve crimes, the areas we’re still woefully bad at it, and how society’s earliest mistakes still color the messed up way in which we view and prosecute right versus wrong.",Jason Pargin

No topic – from abuse of police power to campaign finance reform – has been without vocal opposition from both sides of the issue.
Yet one topic seems especially inflammatory, as it’s been both helped and hindered by the very mechanism of the internet itself: sexism and sexual violence. Yes, Bill Cosby’s victims were empowered by the medium and momentum to come forward and name their abuser. But dig deeper and a similar controversy sits quietly on the backburner as people refuse to name names and victims refuse to come forward, fearing public shaming and career endangerment.
This week on the podcast, Jack O’Brien speaks with Cracked columnist Adam Tod Brown and comedian Dani Fernandez about the unseen difficulties faced by women in the internet age, the powers that try to silence female voices both online and in the real world, and why these issues are magnified in the comedy community.

So this week we’re dedicating a whole podcast to it. Live from the UCB Sunset theatre in Los Angeles, co-hosts Jack O’Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Soren Bowie, Cody Johnston and Dan O’Brien to put to rest the worn-out movie clichés that just need to go away.

But that’s hard to maintain. People get in the way and always seem to let you down, right? A  co worker is a jerk to you and you don’t know why. You hold a door for someone at the coffee shop and then that person and 15 of their friends all stand in front of you in line. What if there  were a simple hack to get  your enemies to work for you; some sort of jedi mind-trick for assholes?
Well, lucky for you, that actually exists and Ben Franklin figured it out two centuries ago. He found that asking people he didn’t get  get along with to do simple favors for him subconsciously forced them into liking him. It’s kind of an anti-golden rule that doesn’t flow off the tongue at all: Have others do unto you what you want and then they’ll continue to do good unto you. ..or something like that. 
This week Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Alex Schmidt to discuss this “Ben Franklin effect” and why it explains some more troubling human behaviors like internet mob culture and why celebrities  slowly turn into their own personas.",Jason Pargin
The Cracked Podcast,86,How Disney Movies Program Your Mind,2015-09-14,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-disney-movies-program-your-mind/,"Think about the Disney princesses of the 1930s, 40s and 50s and what they actually accomplished in their films. Snow White: Hot girl falls asleep in the forest and is almost murdered by dwarfs until they realize how hot she is. Alice in Wonderland: English girl falls asleep at lunch, has crazy dreams, wakes up. Sleeping Beauty: Do you see where we’re going with this?
When you peel away your personal experiences with these movies and just think about their base elements, a dark subtext arises. The Disney filmography from the 1930s to today perpetuates an antiquated American value structure that depicts misogyny, racism, classism and narcissism, yet as kids watching these films and parents showing them to our children, we never think twice about it. Should we be more vigilant in deciphering what these movies are really about instead of just blindly trusting the logo on the Blu-Ray case?
This week on the podcast Jack O’Brien and guest host Tom Reimann are joined by Cracked editors Alex Schmidt, Josh Sargent and Adam Tod Brown. They discuss the grim underpinnings of the Disney film library, how his earliest films are ripe with misogyny, and Jack’s secretly horrifying childhood vacation to a Disney theme park.","Tom Reimann, Adam Tod Brown, Josh Sargent"

We’re good at spotting the dichotomy with insane horror movies that sell themselves as “inspired by actual events.” We know that in real life the doll doesn’t actually come alive and gore the family to death; that it’s a construction of the horror movie genre. But why, when it’s a biopic or a historical drama, do we automatically assume that we’re essentially watching a documentary with contemporary actors?
This week guest host Dan O’Brien is joined by author Liana Maeby and Cracked editor Josh Sargent to discuss the weird relationship between truth and fiction, expectation and reality, and movies that changed the real stories that inspired them for better or worse — usually worse.",""

Do you think you’ll have enough time to make an informed decision? We think so. In fact, you could bury your head in the sand on Mars for another full year and still have enough time to suss out which candidate you think should be the leader of the free world.
But why, over 13 months out, is every news outlet leading with an election story like it’s coming up tomorrow and we still have approximately 45,000 candidates? Why are no serious Republican candidates calling out Trump for being a rodeo clown in a fancy suit? And why do people think Donald Trump can win when — spoiler alert — he’s not going to become President?

They’re a great, simple piece of technology that helps solve the problem, ‘how do we secure this to that?’
Throughout all that time, however, there was just one problem: no one had invented the screwdriver yet. It’s true. People would spend entire lifetimes – generations would come and go – and all they could do to tighten a screw was use a coin or a flat piece of wood or something. It was like society as a whole had left their toolbox in the car but was too lazy to go out and get it.
For every screwdriver we also get an iPhone: a device that, in an instant, crammed the future into the present and forever changed the course of human history.
So there are screwdrivers, and then there are iPhones. Some came 300 years too late and others surprise us 300 years before we expect them.

Case in point: the story of Henry Rathbone. You’re probably thinking, who’s Henry Rathbone? That’s kind of the point. Henry Rathbone and his wife Clara were sitting next to Abraham Lincoln the night of the assassination, and despite the decades of conspiracy theories and ghost stories surrounding the Lincoln family, the craziest and bloodiest story of the night belongs to Mr. Rathbone.
See, in the years following Lincoln’s assassination, Rathbone’s mental state declined as he blamed himself for not being able to prevent the president’s death. Soon after that, he started to believe his walls were talking to him. Then he went full Shining and murdered his wife, tried to murder his children and stabbed himself 5 times in the chest. He spent the rest of his life in an insane asylum. This is an absolutely bonkers story edited from the margins of history, yet we choose not remember it because it doesn’t read like a textbook.
This sort of historical amnesia also applies to how we look at the horror genre. There are countless unsolved murders, disappearances and mass hysterias that we don’t know how to classify just because their details are too strange to swallow, the leads go nowhere and eventually we give up.
So in honor of Halloween, Jack O’Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) share 12 creepy and macabre unsolved mysteries that are just too weird to fit into our cookie-cutter version of the horror genres.","Jack O'Brien, Jason Pargin"

What Zombie Movies Get Right About Real Pandemics,2015-11-01,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/what-zombie-movies-get-right-about-real-pandemics/,"Last year’s worldwide Ebola outbreak brought into harsh reality the kind of imagery we typically only see in movies like ‘Outbreak’ or ‘Contagion’: the faceless officials in hazmat suits, the quarantine tents, the sudden fear of anyone who sneezes on an airplane. Though over 10,000 lives have been lost worldwide, it bears reminding the amount of US lives lost to the virus: one. So despite being bombarded with this cinematic imagery, it’s clear in retrospect that we weren’t in that much danger after all.Was our hysteria overblown? Or was the awareness brought on by the media panic the driving force behind the virus’ containment?
When our perception of pandemics has only ever been framed in the visual language of movies, it’s hard to grasp the actual science behind how these things spread.

It’s a concept that provides for very entertaining movies, but considering we have no plans to fight hordes of aliens or wage a class war on the Lamborghini of space stations, can mech-suits have any real-life applications to us in the coming years? Or are they strictly limited to warfare?
 
Let’s say mech-suits do become a routine part of daily life. Will they help us for the better or just turn us into the soft and doughy humans like those aboard the starship Axiom in ‘Wall-E’?
 
Jack O’Brien ask all of these questions and more of Oliver Mayer, Principal Engineer at GE Global Research and an expert in robotics, who believes we’re all a little bit cyborg already.

While commercially and critically loved, you got the sense watching it that this was something to suspend your disbelief for; that this world of shared dreaming, dreams within dreams and implanting false memories surely had no basis in fact or science. But what if we told you Nolan’s half-baked ideas about the fallibility of memory were actually close to how the brain works? What if planting false memories in people was actually the most realistic part about ‘Inception’?

The part of Marty McFly was originally played by Eric Stoltz (John Travolta’s drug dealer from ‘Pulp Fiction’), and they shot the movie for 5 weeks before ultimately replacing him with Michael J. Fox. The deleted scenes with Stoltz reveal a dour, contemplative Marty and the whole tone of the movie is off – like watching a Twilight Zone version of a movie you’ve seen 100 times before.
This one casting change completely revamped the voice and quality of the movie for the better.

We’re smarter than a generation of people from the early 1900s and the future-people of the 2100s who ride driver-less cars and get wi-fi implanted into their eyelids will laugh at how dumb we are.
Knowing this, the Flynn Effect would actually make time travel a bit more problematic than you thought. If you travel to the past, like Marty in ‘Back to the Future III’, in all likelihood you’d probably be burned as a witch or drawn and quartered for insisting the Earth traveled around the sun. If you go to the future, you’d be considered slow and thick-witted, that’s if the people could understand you at all. You’d be Fry.

It plays out as a fantasy, a hilarious what-if scenario about old people acting young. The movie seems more fiction than science, but in the 30 years since the film’s release, the branch of medicine devoted to curing aging has grown into possibly the next big thing.
Aging has only been a problem since the beginning of time, a disease born into us by the very nature of being alive, but scientists believe we’re not far off from therapies that could extend our lifespan by decades and keep us feeling like we’re in our 30s the whole time.
Jack O’Brien is joined by Laura Deming, a 21-year-old venture capitalist, who is funding the therapies of the future that will slow the process of aging. They discuss some of the breakthroughs in the field and Laura debunks some myths about current life extension treatments.
Jack is then joined by Fiona Ginty, a principal scientist at GE working on the microimaging of cells. Fiona shares how this technology will aid in the fight against aging as that process might be built into our DNA.","Fiona Ginty, Laura Deming"
The Cracked Podcast,99,Innocent Ideas That Spawned Horrific Results,2015-12-07,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/innocent-ideas-that-spawned-horrific-results/,"In 186 3, German chemist Julius Wilbrand was trying to make yellow dye and what he came up with was trinitrotoluene, also known as TNT . Twenty years went by until his creation was actually discovered to be explosive and another twenty went by until the first armies started using TNT to blow stuff up. So what was originally just a yellow dye for some lederhosen in the 19th century eventually became one of the most widely used and deadly explosives of the 20th. 
On this week’s podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Kristi Harrison to share some of the various inventions and ideas throughout history that started off innocent, yet grew into something horrific. They talk about how a single letter in a medical journal started the heroin epidemic, how Hitler used America to model his empire, and how a conversation over a beer led to 160 million women disappearing from history.","Kristi Harrison, Soren Bowie"
The Cracked Podcast,100,BONUS! Why All Your Favorite Movies Are About The Apocalypse,2015-12-13,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/bonus-why-all-your-favorite-movies-are-about-the-apocalypse/,"From ‘Mad Max’ to ‘San Andreas’ to ‘The Avengers,’ the most popular movies of our times are about how we fear our world will end. We’re obsessed with stories of drought, natural disaster, nuclear war, zombies, aliens and robots. We fear the day science fiction turns into science fact, and while some movie apocalypses are basically pure make-believe, others seem eminently possible.
So what are we doing about the threats of water and energy shortages? And are we destined to play out the doomsday scenarios we see in popular science fiction?
In this special bonus episode taped live at the UCB Sunset theatre in Los Angeles, Jack O’Brien, Alex Schmidt and Michael Swaim are joined by three amazing guests to answer these questions and elaborate on the current state of the end of the world. On the science-fiction front, they’re joined by Akiva Goldsman, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of ‘A Beautiful Mind’ and ‘I Am Legend’. And on the real science side, they’re joined by Eric Fitch, whose company Purpose Energy is turning wastewater from beer into renewable energy, and Jon Freedman, whose working to shape international and domestic water policies on behalf of GE Water & Power.","Akiva Goldsman, Eric Fitch, Jon Freedman, Michael Swaim"
The Cracked Podcast,101,A Cultural History Of Star Wars (So Far),2015-12-14,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/a-cultural-history-of-star-wars-so-far/,"Take a trip in your mind back to May 18th, 1999. Bill Clinton was the president, ‘Livin La Vida Loca’ and ‘No Scrubs’ were at the top of the music charts, and there was hope that ‘The Phantom Menace’ would be a great movie. Then the next day happened; the movie was released, and a bit of our collective innocence was forever lost. 
There are videos of fans losing their shit with anticipation lining up to see the movie, and their reactions leaving the theater two hours later. Most said they loved it, but you can hear the twinge of doubt in their voices and see a blankness in their eyes, as if the brain was fighting itself, literally incapable of believing that the movie sucked. And in the coming years we obviously came to a consensus about the prequels: they were the most vile of garbage and George Lucas was persona non grata in the film industry.
It’s sixteen years later and we now hope we’re in a different place, but it’s easy to feel the parallels between where we are now and where we were in May 1999. We have no idea what ‘The Force Awakens’ will bring us later this week. We hope for the best, but also hope we’re not too cynical in expecting the worst. 
On this week’s podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) for a deep dive into the history of Star Wars and how we got to this very moment. They discuss what the original trilogy got right, where the prequels went wrong, and the complicated genius of George Lucas.",Jason Pargin

It seems like there isn’t a single facet of human life that isn’t quantifiable now that our phones and watches are counting each step and and calorie, while Facebook and Twitter collects each thought.
If you don’t think data is important, look what happens when we lose it, or realize we didn’t even have it at all. In 2015 we had two major hacks in Sony and Ashley Madison, found out Volkswagen’s data was a complete lie, and discovered we never were even tracking US police shooting deaths, which is completely *$@#ed.
2015 was a huge year for both the data we had and the data we lost. In our final episode of the year, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien and Creative Director of Video Dan O’Brien are joined by FiveThirtyEight’s Jody Avirgan, host of What’s the Point, to recap the year in data.

What about the rest of us? Isn’t there a great story in the Armageddon expanded universe about a bunch of people partying like the world is going to end and then having to go to work the next day?
What about the thankless IT workers of S.H.I.E.L.D. or any secret organization of that matter? Where are the stories of the people whose job it is to handle the IT tickets when Darth Vader’s hologram doesn’t work or Captain America forgets his password?
In this live episode recorded at the Comikaze Expo in Los Angeles, Jack O’Brien is joined on a panel by Dan O’Brien, Soren Bowie, Michael Swaim, Tom Reimann, Katie Willert, Alex Schmidt, Adam Tod Brown, Cody Johnson and Josh Sargent to discuss movies that would be completely changed if you viewed them from the point of view of the little people.

The Cracked Podcast,104,Great Ideas Nobody Uses Correctly Anymore,2016-01-11,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/great-ideas-nobody-uses/,"Remember when memes actually made sense and weren’t just screencaps of Minions with text like, ‘Obama: You Only Had One Job!’ Remember when ‘First World Problems’ wasn’t an excuse to complainbrag about your yacht running out of champagne? Remember when ‘LOL’ wasn’t a mere punctuation mark and actually meant that someone was laughing out loud?
Pepperidge Farm remembers. And now that meme is probably ruined too. The problem with the internet sometimes is that when creative, novel, and useful ideas get put into it, suddenly everyone has permission to reuse them. From there they get repeatedly misused, and before you know it, they completely lose all of their meaning. Literally. Or figuratively. We don’t know because literally doesn’t mean literally anymore.

The Cracked Podcast,105,Ways America Was Shockingly Evil Very Recently,2016-01-18,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/ways-america-was-shockingly-evil-very-recently/,"If you look back at the most popular comedies through the years, there are always parts that don’t hold up. A lot of the time when it’s a sex, bro, or gross-out comedy, the stuff that doesn’t hold up is usually a cringeworthy scene or two where you think, “they could never do this today.”
For example, Vince Vaughn getting raped in ‘Wedding Crashers’ is played for laughs, but then we feel better about it at the end because he falls in love with his assailant. Shannon Elizabeth’s Nadia in ‘American Pie’ is secretly taped getting naked and her character is deported for it while no punishment comes to the men who do this to her. The villain in ‘Ace Ventura: Pet Detective’ is trans woman outed by a bunch of grossed-out dudes. Funny!
The fact that you can’t get away with stuff like this anymore isn’t a bad sign, or a sign that comedies are becoming PC or watered down. This is a good thing. It means we’re not making fun of genders, races, sexual orientations at their expense for no reason.
On this week’s podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Alex Schmidt to talk about some very recent movies, commercials and bits of pop-culture like these where what was once funny or en vogue is now horribly insensitive.",Soren Bowie
The Cracked Podcast,106,Why The English Language Is Messing With Your Head,2016-01-25,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-the-english-language-is-messing-with-your-head/,"A short list of completely ridiculous things we put up with as English speakers: 
1. I before E except after C (apart from numerous exceptions that you should memorize)
2. The letters C and K making the same sound (except when they don’t)
3. The multiple pronunciations of ‘ough’ (Cough, Through, Rough, Thought, etc.)
4. Different countries putting a U in words like Favo(u)rite or Colo(u)r
What the hell is going on here? How did our language get like this? Why is this the 2nd most spoken language in the world when it makes no sense? 
To get a grasp at the enormity of English, Jack O’Brien is joined on the phone by Susan Bennett, the original voice of Siri, to talk about her time recording every sound in the English language and how programmers put it all together.
Later, Jack is joined onstage at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles by Dan O’Brien, Carmen Angelica and Alex Schmidt. They talk about the history of English, how it combines the best of French and the worst of German, the grammar’s endless nonsensical rules, and some simple things other languages do that we wish we had.",Daniel O'Brien
The Cracked Podcast,107,Mind-Blowing Secrets Behind Your Favorite Music,2016-02-01,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/mind-blowing-secrets-behind-your-favorite-music/,"The history of the music industry is littered with weird and possibly apocryphal stories of how people were discovered and how songs came to be. Sam Phillips, the man credited with discovering Elvis, tells the story of a shy 18-year-old Presley coming into his studio and Phillips having the gut instinct to shout something like, “say, this kid’s gonna be a star!” It’s a fine story, except Phillips wasn’t even there the day Elvis first went into Sun Records. It was his assistant Marion Keisker who heard Elvis first and thought to pass him along to her boss. We like to think of our artists as chess pieces in a heroes journey. It fits the story in our minds to have Elvis be discovered by Obi-Wan Kenobi and for them to have the determination to know ‘Hound Dog’ would be a big hit. But ‘Hound Dog’ was first recorded 4 years earlier by Big Mama Thornton. The history of the music industry is a surprisingly messy thing. Keith Richards comes up with the main riff to ‘Satisfaction’ and forgets how to play it the next day. What sounds like divine inspiration to us might very well be an accident. On this week’s podcast Jack sits down with Hrishikesh Hirway, the brilliant mind behind the podcast ‘Song Exploder’, to talk about his process and what he learns breaking down popular songs instrument-by-instrument. Later he talks with Peter Matthew Bauer of The Walkmen to talk gear culture, how demos are made, and Michael Jackson’s magical $20,000 mixing board.",""
The Cracked Podcast,108,The Horrifying Reality of Teen Rehab Centers,2016-02-08,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-horrifying-reality-of-teen-rehab-centers/,"You’ve probably seen ‘scared straight’ segments on some daytime talk show like ‘Maury’ before. You know the kind where they throw troubled teens in jail for a day to get yelled at by a drill instructor and come out crying for their parents?
What if we told you there was a whole industry set up around this where you can legally have your child kidnapped in the night and sent to the wilderness or to live in a religious group home for months on end? These programs prey on middle-to-upper-class families, operate where there are no child labor laws, and use torture, fear, and manipulation tactics to “fix” troubled youth. Also the counselors need no formal training and are often child molesters.
The best case scenario if you’re a teenager sent to one of these camps is that you come home with PTSD and severe trust issues for the rest of your life, however in many cases you may just die there. It’s one of the scariest things happening in America right now that you probably didn’t know about.
Cracked editors Jack O’Brien and Robert Evans speak with Maia Szalavitz, who literally wrote the book on the teen rehab industry, about how these centers operate and why so many families are conned into paying them thousands of dollars to hurt their kids. Then they speak with Sarah Cummins, whose family sent her to Utah to live in one of these centers where she was forced to manipulate other girls, do endless manual labor and hug her counselor who turned out to be a sex offender.",Maia Szalavitz
The Cracked Podcast,109,Mind-Melting Theories About Consciousness and Your Soul,2016-02-15,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/mind-melting-theories-about-consciousness-and-your-soul/,"Where Western medicine ends is often the place where eye-rolling begins. Just the mere mention of alternative medicine brings up imagery of snake-oil salesmen, chakras and crystals. But in the modern world, we’re so devoted to the materialistic side of science–the stuff that can only be measured and doled out in pill form–we forget how much we don’t know about how the human body works.
Don’t get us wrong, Western medicine is great! We can heal bones, prescribe medications and implant devices that can make the deaf hear again. But when it comes to dealing with dementia, autism, strokes, or anything inside the brain, we might as well be in the middle ages. How can we help a child locked inside his own mind when we barely understand what the mind is? How can we ethically take a comatose person off life support when your best guess for the definition of consciousness is as good as ours?
Jack O’Brien is joined in-studio this week by David Huntsberger, host of the now-defunct podcast Professor Blastoff, for a very heady conversation about consciousness, the brain, the mind, and searching for therapies at the edge of Western medicine.",David Huntsberger

We can see through your failed attempts to reach a new generation: the Anne Hathaway/James Franco catastrophe, the phony (get it?) Ellen DeGeneres selfie stunt that was totally unscripted and Samsung definitely didn’t pay the Oscars $20 million in advance for. Just stop it already. Take a few years off.
In the meantime, we at Cracked have come up with a bunch of new categories that you’re totally free to steal, such as Best Title, Best Running Time, Best Accent and Best Oscar-Bait That Didn’t Get Any Nominations Other Than This One.

The Cracked Podcast,111,Why Narcissism Is Our National Mental Disorder,2016-02-29,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-narcissism-is-our-national-mental-disorder/,"If you go back one hundred or even fifty years ago to ask kids what they wanted when they grew up, they’d say they wanted to have families and to have good jobs. Now when you ask that question to kids the resounding answer is, “to be famous.” Not to be a famous actor or a famous musician or athlete, just to be famous. And in our culture being famous is an easy reality. There are real Twitter and Vine and Instagram celebrities, but in a way we’re all the star of our own curated reality show, broadcast over Facebook updates and Snapchat stories. We have a word for this kind of self-aggrandizing behavior-narcissism-but sometimes we use that word to mean “asshole” or “jerk” when there’s an actual clinical meaning behind it that’s much more complicated than the informal insult. Narcissism is a diagnosable condition that statistically only 1% of the population has. But why does it seem people are becoming more self-obsessed, more vain, more arrogant? In this week’s episode, Jack O’Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) flesh out the theory that narcissism has become our cultural status quo. They discuss the differences between clinical narcissism and our colloquial version of the word; how Hitler, Trump, Jobs and countless other celebrities were certified narcissists; and how narcissism plays a part in Harry Potter and the new Star Wars.

The Cracked Podcast,112,Escaping America’s Creepy Teen Rehab Industry,2016-03-07,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/escaping-americas-creepy-teen-rehab-industry/,"A few weeks ago we presented you some stories about a terrifying underground industry in America. An industry in which middle and upper-class families pay tens of thousands of dollars to have their children kidnapped in the middle of the night and sent to rehabilitation centers. These ‘troubled’ teens ares sent away for reasons ranging from getting caught smoking pot, to getting bad grades, to having a new step-parent that just plain doesn’t like you. These unregulated rehab centers across America are often hyper-religious and don’t require their counselors to have any formal training, resulting in systematic mental, physical and sometimes sexual abuse. The worst part is: the parents have no idea. They’re told ahead of time that their kids will lie, beg and make up tall tales to get out of these camps, and to ignore these pleas as it’s all part of the healing process. While preparing for our podcast a few weeks ago, we came across a story so harrowing and unbelievable, we just had to make it it’s own episode. Jack O’Brien and Robert Evans are joined by Darlene Molina, who recounts her story of being sent to two camps, getting kicked out of one, and escaping the other. Also make sure to get your tickets to the next live podcast taping on Wednesday, March 9th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre. Jack O’Brien, Carmen Angelica, Dan O’Brien, Alex Schmidt, and Jake Weisman will discuss all the ways our dogs and cats are more powerful, creepy, and awesome than we ever could have imagined.

Sometimes the battle lines are drawn across gender lines; the term cat-lady evokes an image in your head in a way cat-man doesn’t. We use the word dog to colloquialize a sly, rakish man. Often we choose sides purely based on what our parents allowed in the house when we were kids. But rarely we stop to consider all the crazy superpowers our pets have: like how dogs can read human emotions better than other humans can, and how a cat’s purr can improve your bone density. Recorded live at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, Team Dog (Jack O’Brien, Dan O’Brien, Cody Johnston), Team Cat (Carmen Angelica, Jake Weisman) and Team Turtle (Alex Schmidt) go back and forth with rarely-known facts about the pets we keep at home to decide who is the ultimate victor in this war that has been waged for millennia. Team Cat will blow up the way you think about the gender binary, and we may decide after it all that the best pet to have is a pig.

But he’s like, 30 seconds old, how would he know anything about that? None of us have these virtues and we’re not wooden little puppet-devils.
Inspired by last week’s video, Jack O’Brien, Daniel O’Brien and Soren Bowie sit down for a conversation about the ways children’s entertainment was either secretly horrifying, or simply giving us awful life-lessons. They talk about how the Nickelodeon shows of the 90s led to a generation of depressed loners, JK Rowling’s subtle misanthropy, how the early Disney princesses were awful representations of women, and how Winnie the Pooh set back how we deal with mental health.","Daniel O'Brien, Soren Bowie"
The Cracked Podcast,115,America’s Secret Caste System,2016-03-28,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/americas-secret-caste-system/,"We tend to think of the class system as money thing. Rich people are high-class, poor people are of a lower class, and those things can change with the purchase of a lottery ticket or one bad financial investment. But that common understanding of class in America is not really how things work.
Think of how many lottery winners are bankrupt within years because they overspend on frivolous things that would seem impressive to their own class. That explains Donald Trump’s rise to political power. He’s basically the lower class idea of wealth: he owns golf courses and casinos, has his name on everything, and is obsessed with gold. To your Vanderbilts or Rockefellers, he’s a clown, but to lower class people, his lifestyle is something to strive for.
On this week’s episode Jack O’Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) take a deep dive into how we perceive class in America, what most people get wrong about it, and the surprising ways class is confused with race.

It wasn’t even until the 60s and 70s that therapy, medication and other modern treatments became mainstream. Before that we would just throw people in the looney bin, give them electro-shock therapy or pull out all their teeth if they were schizophrenic or suffering from depression. So it goes without saying that there were multitudes of people throughout history who were suffering from autism, addiction, bipolar disorder, ADHD and so on who were never treated. Many of these people went on to do great things– sometimes because of and sometimes in spite of their mental conditions. They were our Beethovens, our Lincolns, our Jeffersons and our Einsteins. This week we’re taking a look into the past and shining a light on the famous historical figures you may not know were suffering from major mental illnesses. Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien first speaks with Claudia Kalb, a medical and science journalist who literally wrote the book on the subject, about Abraham Lincoln, Andy Warhol, Marilyn Monroe and whether modern treatments are medicating away the next generation of greats like these. Jack then speaks with Cracked editor Robert Evans about how many of these diseases may have evolved and benefitted prehistoric society, and the surprising way Syphilis ties into all of this.

Instead of dissecting the movies this week, we thought we should go straight to the source and talk to directors themselves about how their films are inspired and made. Recorded in Austin, Jack O’Brien sits down with three filmmakers for intimate conversations about their respective SXSW premiere films. First, Jack musters up the courage to talk to one of his favorite directors, Jeff Nichols, about the Southern and Speilbergian influences in his new sci-fi film ‘Midnight Special’. Jack is then joined by writer/director/actor Linas Phillips for a wide-ranging conversation about his film ‘Rainbow Time’, and how it truthfully depicts the mentally challenged, family, and sex. Finally, Jack, along with Cracked’s Soren Bowie and Daniel O’Brien, sit down for a hilarious conversation with comedian/writer Henry Phillips about his movie ‘And Punching the Clown’ and how it farcically weaves together elements of his stand-up, his music and his real life.

They’ve been doing this for years and you haven’t even noticed it. Think about your grocery store. Right after you walk in, there’s probably fresh flowers and produce. That’s because supermarkets know that if you see fresh stuff when you walk in, you’ll want to buy more food. There are subtle design features built into almost every facet of day-to-day life that are specifically engineered to get you to think a certain way, behave a certain way, and buy more stuff. This might sound like the ravings of someone whose car is covered in conspiracy theory bumper stickers, but once you start to notice the patterns and the reasoning, you’ll see it everywhere.This week Jack O’Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss how supermarkets, car companies, local governments and more use mind control every day without you even realizing it.

The Cracked Podcast,119,Which Civilization in History Was the Happiest?,2016-04-18,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/which-civilization-in-history-was-the-happiest/,"If you could go anywhere in time to live the rest of your life, where would you go? It probably depends on what you’re looking for. Would you be looking to live in a time of relative peace, a time of great technological advancement, or simply a time where there wasn’t some horrible plague killing off everybody you know and love? Doc Brown thought he had it all in the 1880s, but that period probably wouldn’t be super awesome if you were a woman or a minority. Actually most time periods would be pretty bad in those circumstances. Not to mention that humans knew nothing about medicine and just generally not dying all the time until very recently. So obviously it’s a difficult question with an unclear answer: when was the best time in human history to be alive? Hell, the answer might just be today. As in, whatever day you’re reading this. This is the best day. To figure out this question, Jack O’Brien is first joined by Peter Stearns, author and professor at George Mason University to talk about the place of happiness in human history: which civilizations had it, which didn’t, and when and where were they? Later, Jack talks about Cracked Podcast pet subject the Flynn Effect with none other than Jim Flynn, the guy who put his name on it. If every generation is getting slightly smarter than the last, how does that affect quality of life, and is there a limit to how smart humans can get?

The Cracked Podcast,120,"8 Historical Badasses You’ve Never Heard Of, Pt. 2",2016-04-25,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/8-historical-badasses-youve-never-heard-of-pt-2/,"Two years ago we told you the tales of some of the most badass people lost to the annals of history. There was Peter Freuchen, the 6’7″ Danish explorer who clawed his way out of an ice cave using a shovel he made out of his own feces; and Elmer Keith, who could shoot objects from hundreds of yards away with the accuracy of a sniper, except he could do it with a revolver, one of the least accurate guns you could use in long-range. That episode (https://goo.gl/nyhS0s) was so popular and there were so many people we had to leave out, it was absolutely imperative we come back with more epic stories of incredible people you’ve probably never heard of. Just to name a few, this year, we have a crazy land mine defuser, a ruthless pirate queen and a gay revolutionary war hero who was half Rambo/half Santa Claus. Co-hosts Jack O’Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Cracked writers Alex Schmidt, Carmen Angelica, Josh Sargent and Tom Reimann, and comedians Ian Abramson and Blake Wexler. It’s a heroic tournament-style podcast where one person will be crowned the ultimate unknown badass, winning a very special prize of our temporary respect and adoration.

Yes, we get it; we’re loud, we’re brash, we’re fat, we love NASCAR and think everyone should speak gosh darn American. These stereotypes in a way are almost self-imposed. We see ‘Team America’ and we assume that sardonic parody of patriotism is how the rest of the world views us, but that’s not always the case.
There are tons of stereotypes about Americans we have no idea about because they’re things that are so normal to us we don’t even notice them. Take cheese, for example. We LOVE cheese, and sure, other countries love it too, but to an Easterner, cheese is a gross, spongy, smelly alien substance. We know our political system is definitely on the wacky side of things, but do we even comprehend how our election looks to the rest of the world, nervously praying Donald Trump doesn’t get the nuclear codes?
On this episode, we’re joined by a few foreigners to talk about all the weird things we do as Americans, but have no idea about. Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien is joined by Japanese comedian Aiko Tanaka and British comedian Katia Kvinge to talk about our weird food culture and our even weirder dating culture. Later, Jack is joined by Cracked editor and resident Canadian Mark Hill to talk about why American technology lags far behind along with our politics.

Deep inside us all behind our political leanings, our moral codes and our private biases, there is a cause so colossally stupid, we surprise ourselves with how much we care. Whether it’s toilet paper position, fedoras on men or Oxford commas, we each harbor a preference so powerful we can’t help but proselytize to the world. Guest host Soren Bowie will be joined by Cody Johnston, Michael Swaim and comedian Annie Lederman to discuss the most trivial things we will argue about until the day we die.

The Cracked Podcast,122,Why The Cool Kids From High School Die First,2016-05-09,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-the-cool-kids-from-high-school-die-first/,"Why do we think Ned Flanders is so lame? He’s outgoing and nice, is always happy to lend out his lawn equipment and looks amazing in ski-wear. 
Let’s first start off by saying, no, the theme behind this episode is not why left-handed people are lame, but we are talking about giving hugs and high fives, staying away from cigarettes and alcohol, loving thy neighbor and all of the attributes we normally credit to boring people. Unfortunately for many of our dear readers and listeners, it’s actually scientifically proven that working hard and having less fun leads to a longer, healthier life. 
On this week’s episode, Jack O’Brien, Josh Sargent and Alex Schmidt discuss the ways that uncool behavior is actually beneficial to both the individual and society overall. They try to figure out why, despite all this, our culture still loves the bad boy and thinks nice guys finish last.

Do you think of Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant and sophisticated doctor who treats murder with the joy of a foodie at a gourmet mac & cheese bar? Or do you think of John Doe from ‘Seven’, a man who goes out of his way to create the most elaborately constructed crime scenes in order to make a thematic point to the police?
Either way, you’re probably imagining someone way more competent than an actual serial killer. Real murder is messy, and the real reason serial killers get away with what they do is because they’re brilliant at feigning human emotion. Evil, yes, but they’re not super-geniuses, laughing maniacally at a collage of pictures and string on a wall.
On this week’s episode, Jack O’Brien is joined by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, the hosts of the podcast ‘My Favorite Murder’ (http://goo.gl/gpaZN8) to discuss the common assumptions we get wrong about serial killers, theories surrounding the JFK, RFK, and JonBenet Ramsey murders and, of course, some of their favorite murder stories.

Or maybe not, because those are all completely contradictory and made up by who, exactly? Some sort of internal rhyme shaman or sarcastic centuries-old grandmother?
Where the hell did we get all these idioms from? A stitch in time saves nine? Turns out we’ve been saying that one wrong, there should be a comma in there. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket? Well, I only have two hands, how many baskets should I be carrying? 
These situational little quips make us feel better in very specific moments, but the amount of them that seem to be direct opposites lead us to believe maybe none of them are worthwhile. On this week’s episode, Jack O’Brien is joined by Michael Swaim to pour through the dozens of axioms that, when you think about them for a little bit, don’t really give the best advice. Later they open up Poor Richard’s Almanack, the 18th century source for many of these proverbs, and go through some of the sayings that didn’t quite make it to the 21st century.

The only reason we ask is because a recent thread (http://goo.gl/49Viln) melted the Cracked.com forums when our dear readers realized that people had slightly different bathroom preferences than them.
As we looked upon the carnage, we realized there are so many insignificant topics that people feel almost violently confident about: hanging your toilet paper over or under, oxford commas, whether to say ‘the’ before the number of a freeway. No matter which side of the aisle you come down on, you know that anyone who disagrees with you is wrong and should probably be sent via a rocket into the sun.
These insignificant topics are what we’re talking about on this week’s podcast. Special guest-host Soren Bowie is joined by Cracked’s Cody Johnston and Michael Swaim and comedian Annie Lederman for a graphic conversation about what these topics are and why they’re so easy to fight over.

Believe it or not, the beginning of modern rocket science wasn’t helmed by some nerds in a laboratory, but by a group of rockstar scientists who blew stuff up by day and did drugs and animal sacrifices at night. Jack Parsons was the leader, and in his short life he fought with L. Ron Hubbard over women, led a branch of an occultist religion and founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
Parsons is just one of the many consequential people we discuss on this week’s podcast who shaped the modern era, but had life stories that you wouldn’t believe. Jack O’Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by comedian and host of ‘Paranormal You & Me’ Ryan Singer to delve into the life and beliefs of Parsons, and discuss others such as George Washington’s femme fatale superspy and the Russian officer who prevented the end of the world.

The Cracked Podcast,127,Insane Simpsons Easter Eggs (Explained By Simpsons Writers),2016-06-13,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/insane-simpsons-easter-eggs-explained-by-simpsons-writers/,"Fan theories are kind of our thing. We talk about them on this podcast (https://goo.gl/dZXW05) and in our articles (http://goo.gl/dSyV31). We even created After Hours (https://goo.gl/uQqjmK), a whole series dedicated to fleshing out even the most unrealistic interpretations of our favorite TV shows and movies. But rarely do the creators of the pop culture we love reach out to us about our theories.
A few months ago we released an After Hours episode (https://goo.gl/aFfIAr) where we presented some pretty out-there speculations about the Simpsons universe. We thought Bart, Lisa and Marge represented Freud’s id, ego and superego, and we thought the universe as a whole was populated by thousands of clones. Little did we know how wrong we were.
We thought they were fun what-ifs, but long-time Simpsons writer Mike Reiss emailed us to tell us our theories were pure fantasy. So we thought we’d have him on the podcast! Mike along with Simpsons writer Jeff Martin sit down with Jack O’Brien, Dan O’Brien and Michael Swaim for a long discussion about Simpsons fan theories and the origins of some of our favorite episodes and jokes.

The Cracked Podcast,128,Why We Can Improve Humanity With the Power of Bees,2016-06-20,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-we-can-improve-humanity-with-the-power-of-bees/,"We have a lot of phrases for describing large groups of humans, and none of them are good. We fear the mob mentality and use words like ‘herd’ or ‘sheep’ to describe how dumb we can get in big groups. But what if there were a way to harness our collective intelligence and use it to amplify our best qualities instead of our worst?
That’s what Louis Rosenberg did when he founded Unanimous AI, a company that looked at how swarms of bees make decisions, and developed a program to allow humans to make decisions and predictions in the same way. Instead of voting, decisions are made as a collective.
Okay, but what do you do with this, you ask? Using swarm intelligence, Unanimous AI was able to predict the Kentucky Derby, the Oscars and routinely beats Las Vegas oddsmakers when predicting sports like hockey and football.
Rightly amazed by this awesome new superpower, Jack O’Brien chats with Louis about how his technology works, how it was modeled off the behavior of honey bees, and the surprising things it found about human morality.

The works of Jules Verne inspired the first submarines and Star Trek’s communicators and tablets clearly inspired the smart phones and computers and voice-activated assistants we use today. But there’s still so much we don’t have yet.
Space colonies, faster-than-light travel, teleportation, genetic manipulation — there’s so much cool stuff we see in movies and TV that still seem decades if not centuries away. Sex bots! There are sex bots in everything, but look around– there are no sex bots to be found. A real tragedy.
So this week we’re going to play pretend and talk about the tropes and imagery from sci-fi that we wish were a reality. Jack O’Brien and co-host Adam Tod Brown are joined by Cracked’s Tom Reimann and Josh Sargent as well as comedians David Huntsberger, Caitlin Gill and Lizzy Cooperman to talk robots, generation ships, babies with grasshopper legs and more in this exploration of the sci-fi stuff we really want but probably can’t have.

There are so many cults all around us and they exist in many forms. The picture in your mind may be of a secluded ranch with some long-haired guy trying to sleep with as many women as possible, but that isn’t the only type of cult out there. Yes there are your Scientologies and your Heaven’s Gates, but Apple is a cult too. So is Disney. 
One of the most powerful cults in the world right now is ISIS. They have a government and an army, but their mission and ideology aligns more with a cult than with a country.
All these facets of cultism are discussed on this week’s show. Jack O’Brien is joined by author Karen Stollznow to discuss why America is such a good breeding ground for cults. Later, author Steven Hassan talks about mind control and how he now spends his time counseling former cult members.
Make sure to buy tickets to our next live podcast taping where we get heavy and talk about the afterlife, maaan!

What if the Zoroastrians were right and it doesn’t matter how good you are in your life, you just have to cross a rickety bridge guarded by two four-eyed dogs to reach eternal salvation?

A little, “these aren’t the droids your looking for,” here, a little (insert witty line) there, and bam, you’re making out with the foxy bank teller back at HQ by happy hour.
Now if that were true, we’d all be hostage negotiators, right? But the job isn’t that simple. It’s much more passive than we think and involves a lot more teamwork than just one man walking into a building with only a bullhorn and his gut instinct.
To learn what we all get wrong about hostage negotiators, Jack jack is joined by Chris Voss; author, professor and former lead international kidnapping negotiator for the FBI. They discuss how teamwork and active listening are two of the most important parts of the job, and then Chris explains how hostage negotiation skills can be used in business and in real life.

When you’re walking on a sidewalk and there’s a group of people in front of you, do you want to run them over with a snowblower because they’re arranged in such a way that it’s impossible to navigate around them? When there’s someone in a coffee shop talking loudly on their phone, do you want to plunge them and their stupid conversation to the bottom of the Mariana Trench for the rest of time?
 
If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you’re not being an asshole, that’s just evolution baby. Apparently we’re hard-wired to think people are jerks and there’s absolutely nothing we can do about it.
 
To commemorate the arrival of ‘Difficult People’ season 2 on Hulu, Jack O’Brien, Josh Sargent and Alex Schmidt discuss the scientifically proven ways humans are just awful–from our bad driving habits to the cognitive bias that proves why stupid people think they’re smart. Trust us, it’s not you, it’s them.

We just think the future is some imaginary place that we’ll always to go later. That’s why we’re great at fun things like procrastinating, drinking and smoking. 
Chinese, on the other hand, doesn’t have tenses at all, so native speakers find themselves naturally better at planning for the time ahead. For Chinese speakers, the future isn’t some magical fairy island that will always come tomorrow–the structure of the language just makes the consequences of life more immediate in their brains.
These little cultural differences literally affect how we perceive the world. In languages with more words for the color green, for example, speakers can actually see more shades of green than us. What is a superpower to us is completely mundane to them because they’ve just had that language and ability their whole life.
On this week’s podcast Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to outline some of the scientific ways our brains trick us with this phenomenon– how our sense perception, something we assume is uniform across all humanity, actually changes depending on what culture we’re brought up in.

The Cracked Podcast,134,Why Our Society Is Engineered To Make Us Feel Lonely,2016-07-25,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-our-society-is-engineered-to-make-us-feel-lonely/,"The prominent philosophers The Righteous Brothers once warned about “los[ing] that loving feeling,” and the sentiment was famously echoed in the 1986 fighter pilot documentary ‘Top Gun’. After having lost said loving feeling, the brothers (not actually brothers) felt as if they couldn’t go on. The sensation they felt wasn’t poetic exaggeration. The Righteous Brothers, along with brothers Maverick and Goose were experiencing a very real and potentially dangerous biological response known as skin hunger.
Skin hunger is your body’s reaction to lack of physical touch and it affects an increasing number of Americans while being a non existent phenomenon in more touch-happy countries like France. The problem that we’re learning is that without skin-to-skin touch (might we add that it doesn’t have to be sexual), your body doesn’t produce the hormone oxytocin. Without that natural chemical, adults are more susceptible to depression and infants can have developmental problems or even die.
On this week’s podcast, Jack O’Brien and Cracked editor Robert Evans are first joined by Dr. Kory Floyd, a professor at the University of Arizona, to talk about the physiological and sociological repercussions of skin hunger and why it’s so prominent in today’s culture. Later Jack and Robert are joined by Jean Franzblau of the Cuddle Sanctuary in Los Angeles and Travis Ashkenasy, an independent contractor, to talk about the services they provide as professional cuddlers and why you shouldn’t be embarrassed to seek out a cuddle party.

You’ve died in a fictional universe where the afterlife exists! How cool is that? Aren’t you happy you’re not in the Tarantino-verse? Instead of your soul escaping to the great unknown, you get to hang out and make pottery with Whoopi Goldberg, contract the exorcism services of whatever Beetlejuice is, or get treated like vermin by a team of New York City exterminators (of indeterminate gender). 
So what will it be? What would be the best pop-culture afterlife to spend your eternity in? 
To figure that out, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked’s Daniel O’Brien and Michael Swaim and comedian and artist Ramin Nazer. They also discuss some of the worst afterlife scenarios from ancient religions, create their own perfect afterlife and talk about who they’d haunt if they were ghosts.
Also don’t forget to buy tickets to our next live podcast taping on Saturday, August 13th at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles!
In the muggle world, we’re not given the opportunity for a magical hat to tell us which school we should go to. Usually we just have to go to the high school closest to where we live or whatever college accepts our SAT scores and personal essay. This month, our goal is to determine what would be the best fictional school to go to.
Join Jack, Daniel, the rest of the Cracked staff and some special guests as they figure out if it’s a realistic school like Degrassi or West Beverly High, or an institution from a fantasy world like Hogwarts with its ghosts and dementors, or Bayside High, haunted by a monster known only to humans as ‘Screech.’

You watch one episode of ‘Mythbusters’ and suddenly you’re an expert on ballistics, germ theory and aeronautical engineering.
Tell me then, Jonas Salk, why you always get sick on airplanes. You’re probably thinking it has something to do with the recycled air. Five hours spent breathing the same diseased air as the commoners back in coach and you’re bound to come down with something, right? Wrong, you aristocratic pig!
You can actually blame the airlines and flight attendants for this one. Don’t you think it’s weird how the plane gets clean in the 20 minutes between when the plane lands and when they ask you to board? Yeah, that’s because they don’t clean it. Every surface on an airplane is a plastic germ-ridden hellscape trying to eat you from the insides out. That’s why you get sick when you fly.
There are plenty of other everyday systems and things whose inner workings are taken for granted like that. Jack O’Brien is joined this week by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Kristi Harrison for a roundup of things that don’t work how you’d expect: from airplanes, to soap, to the world economy.

Meanwhile Smith is playing second fiddle in poorly – reviewed DC expanded universe movies and is probably questioning  when it all went wrong. 
The chronicle of filmmaking is peppered with anecdotes like these; crazy what-ifs that had they gone the other way, maybe history wouldn’t be totally different ,  but the movies we love would. 
On this week’s podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked columnists David Christopher Bell and Josh Sargent to talk about  some of these movie what-ifs and then take it one step further: think of some  disappointing movies  from the last few years that would be fixed with one simple change.

Everyone gets assigned a very useful pet owl, you can fly around on broomsticks and you don’t have to stick to MLA formatting or learn differential geometry. Sounds great! Except everyone is dying all the time.  Cedric Diggory. Dead. Fred Weasley. Dead. Let’s face it, if there was an evil wizard trying to put an end to humanity on the campus of Ohio State, people would stop going there.
Just to recap – Hogwarts: 
Pros: magic and other cool stuff
Cons: death is everywhere.
By this logic, our goal this episode is to figure out what would be the best fictional school to attend. We found that most schools in fiction have a much higher death rate than the normal high school or university. We’ll take that into consideration. 
Co-hosts Jack O’Brien and Daniel O’Brien are joined by Cracked’s Josh Sargent and Alex Schmidt, and comedians Alison Leiby, Brandie Posey, Riley Silverman and Steven Wilbur to talk Hogwarts, Starfleet Academy, Sunnydale High and more.

The Cracked Podcast,139,How Evolution Made Us Unfit For The Modern World,2016-08-29,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-evolution-made-us-unfit-for-the-modern-world/,"Are you ever so overwhelmed by the thought of going out to socialize that you just stay home instead? And then once you stay home, you’re bummed out at yourself for not leaving the house in the first place? Is your typical party maneuver to hang out in the corner pretending to text someone? Is the slow march of time a crippling experience that can only be made bearable by drinking alcohol and seeking out progressively more dangerous experiences?
Oh. Whew. Us too!
Seems that anxiety and depression are taking a bigger stranglehold of our culture and there are actually some statistics to back that up. Suicides are at a 30 year high, drinking is at a 25 year high, rates of depression are up 800 percent over 70 years and prescriptions for antidepressants were up 400 percent between 1988 and 2011. That’s some grim shit. But we have a theory as to why this may be happening.
Around some 200,000ish years ago, the human brain stopped evolving, but our culture hasn’t. Rigorous jobs, ever-expanding social networks, complex societal problems have all made our lives more convoluted, but our brains were only designed to handle things like, “where’s the fire?” and, “hey, there are some deer over there.” Evolution has left us hanging and we don’t know how to cope. 
For a multi-tiered deep-dive into this subject, Jack O’Brien is first joined by Cracked executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to discuss the increasing role of anxiety in our population. Later, Jono Zalay, the world’s foremost comedian with a PhD in neuroscience, joins the conversation to talk about the role of drugs in this equation and some of the scientific reasons for why our brain needs anxiety.
Also, make sure to come to our next live podcast taping on Saturday, September 10th at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, where Jack and the Cracked staff will flip-off movies like ‘Sully’ and ‘Deepwater Horizon’ and pitch some insane true stories that should be made into big Hollywood movies instead.

The Cracked Podcast,140,How Liberals Are Accidentally Fueling Science Deniers,2016-09-05,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-liberals-are-accidentally-fueling-science-deniers/,"We’ve never known more about our world and our universe, but at the same time it feels like there are more people who completely ignore science than ever before. They can come in all shapes and forms of crazy. There are anti-vaxxers, climate change truthers, and for some reason we’ve still got flat-earthers. Flat-earthers! C’mon people what year is it?! Didn’t Magellan put that one to rest, like, 500 years ago?
Surely this all comes down to religion, right?
Not exactly. A Gallup poll found that about 40% of Americans believe Earth was created by God less than 10,000 years ago. However, of that group, 23% don’t go to church. So almost a quarter of young-Earthers aren’t even religious. What’s going on? What are the sociological forces keeping these ideas so strongly rooted in so many people’s heads?
On this week’s podcast Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Alex Schmidt to cover the modern history of science deniers. We ask where they come from, why they are so prominent now, and if we have to think of science and myth as contradictory.
Also, make sure to come to our next live podcast taping on Saturday, September 10th at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, where Jack and the Cracked staff will flip-off movies like ‘Sully’ and ‘Deepwater Horizon’ and pitch some insane true stories that should be made into big Hollywood movies instead.

Take the inconceivable geometry you do in your head all the time, thanks to your ears. Say you’re standing with your back facing a street and you hear a car approaching from the right–how do you know that? Your brain is instantly calculating the miniscule differences in volume and the slight difference in time it takes for the sound of the car to reach both ears. Yes, thank you Captain Obvious, but it’s still an amazing feat that you’re performing all the time, every day, with everything you hear.
You probably don’t even know how much you hear every day, how unaccustomed to silence you actually are. Silence actually sounds weird, your brain knows something is wrong when it’s absolutely quiet. Conversely, really loud places like cities take up so much of your subconscious mental capacities that they also create a sense of unnerving. That’s why the sound of nature is so relaxing to us.
On this week’s podcast Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien is joined by actor/comedian Johnny Pemberton, whose podcast ‘Twisting the Wind’ is an incredible aural experiment, a constantly surprising manipulation of sound that pushes the boundaries of what’s expected in a podcast. They talk about the power of noise pollution, incredible Tuvan throat singing rap music, how John Williams stole everything from Russian composers and sonic devices that mess with our heads like speech jammers and The Mosquito.

This month alone we’ve got 3 true story movies that shouldn’t have much suspense to them: ‘Sully’ (the plane lands); ‘Deepwater Horizon’ (oil gets everywhere); and ‘Snowden’ (dude’s in Russia).
We’ve got a little hint for you, Hollywood: how about releasing a movie that isn’t about something that happened, like, six seconds ago? History is full of amazing true stories and you’re giving us a movie about the most unceremonious, bloodless and explosion-less crash in the history of aviation? Pshhh.
This week we’ve got seven true stories for you that we promise would make better movies than ‘Snowden’: from the mad warring paleontologists who would rather burn down a museum than see each other gain a modicum of success, to the 10th century Slavic saint who murdered just everybody. Jack O’Brien and Michael Swaim co-host live from the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles with Cracked guests Carmen Angelica, Tom Reimann and Alex Schmidt, and guest comedians Lindsay Adams, Sunah Bilsted, Eli Olsberg and Steven Wilber.
Jack is also joined by Cracked writer and researcher Evan Caris to talk about a major world event that is always underserved in film: World War I.

The Cracked Podcast,143,Stupid Lies From Pop Culture That Everybody Believes,2016-09-26,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/stupid-lies-from-pop-culture-that-everybody-believes/,"We all know Rome wasn’t built in a day. But in the fake Hollywood adaptation, “Rome Wasn’t Built in a Day,” it’s probably built over the course of a short montage set to peppy music, where it feels like it’s built in 20 minutes.
That’s one of the subtle lies movies and TV imprint on our minds- that monumental things can be achieved in relatively short periods of time or with relatively little effort. Doc Brown hits his head and comes up with the idea for a time machine, and the hardest part is sourcing plutonium from a crew of gullible Libyan terrorists. This myth of invention affects how we look at history too. In our minds, Thomas Edison is a guy who just pulled the idea for the light bulb out of thin air (or from about 3 inches above his head, right after he thought of it), but he’s just the guy who happened to invent the best one.
These recurring myths are what we’re talking about today. Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked’s Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Alex Schmidt to talk about this invention myth, why we mistakenly think the President controls the economy, how we assume that there are real-life criminals like movie criminals and why a bomb with a timer on it is the stupidest idea in the world.
Also, make sure to come see our THREE live shows this October!
First, at 9pm on Thursday, October 6th at the UCB Sunset Inner Sanctum, Jack O’Brien and Daniel O’Brien take a behind-the-scenes look at America’s most underappreciated profession: teachers.

Tickets are FREE, but it’s first come, first serve, so make sure to arrive early. More info is available here: https://goo.gl/XcGndb
Next, at 7pm on Saturday, October 8th at the UCB Sunset Theatre, Jack O’Brien and Nick Mundy co-host a sequel to last year’s Halloween episode. Cracked’s Tom Reimann and comedians Eric Lampaert, Anna Seregina and Ryan Singer guest to share more real-life stories of death, disappearance and potentially the great beyond.

The Cracked Podcast,144,Why The Best Treatment for PTSD May Be An Illegal Drug,2016-10-03,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-the-best-treatment-for-ptsd-may-be-an-illegal-drug/,"Psychedelics, maaaaan! Gateway to the inside of your miiiiiiiind! Enemy of the maaaaan, maaaaan! Also, a thing that’s been around for so long in human history, we don’t even have an accurate date for when our ancestors started doing them. They’ve just been, for all we know, a common way to explore, escape and seek spiritual oneness for hundreds of thousands of years.
Some great stuff has been conceived of while on psychedelics: while on LSD, Francis Crick conceived of the double-helix shape of DNA, Steve Jobs cites LSD as one of the major influences of his life’s work, and some biblical scholars think the Bible may have been written with the aid of some magic mushrooms. So why does the government hate the stuff? Especially as more research is coming out that says that psilocybin (the active ingredient in mushrooms) does wonders for the terminally ill and MDMA may be the key to curing PTSD.
On this week’s podcast Jack O’Brien enlists the help of comic Shane Mauss and Cracked editor Robert Evans to find out. First Jack and Shane examine some of the medicinal effects of psychedelics, from mushrooms to DMT to MDMA, and talk about how America’s war on drugs is prohibiting important research into these areas. Later, Robert Evans calls in to discuss how some ancient cultures got high and how an individual’s reaction to drugs may not be chemical, but cultural.

The Cracked Podcast,145,Why Science Has Really Basic Stuff Wrong About Humans,2016-10-10,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-science-has-really-basic-stuff-wrong-about-humans/,"How many times a week do you see someone posting a headline to Facebook with a ridiculous scientific claim about your health? ‘9 out of 10 Doctors Say You Should Stop Exercising,’ ‘New Report Shows Milk Prevents Cancer,’ ‘New Study Shows Milk Is Pure Poison, Stop Drinking Milk Or Else Everyone You Know Will Die!’ If you’re like us, you probably don’t even pay attention to them anymore because the results are so fluid and often contradictory. Tell us now– are eggs good for you? You have no idea. Yes, but not the yolks? Who the hell knows anymore?
There’s a reason why so many studies about human health and behavior are so unpredictable, and you may not be happy with the answer. It’s because studying humans is freaking impossible, and that’s never going to change. When you’re studying people, there’s an endless amount of incalculable variables that make reaching a conclusion a futile undertaking. And even if you control for as many factors as you can think of, you still might not be able to account for your subjects’ genetics or the very likely chance that they’re just lying to you. “Oh, my diet? Yeah, I eat 2 salads a day, no dressing, and a plain cut of grilled chicken for dinner. I definitely didn’t drive through McDonalds on the way here and order a #3 with a Dr. Pepper, no pickles.”
In conclusion, don’t trust anything you read or hear ever, or do, because science doesn’t really know what it’s doing. On this week’s episode Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O’Brien is joined by executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to talk about how and why science fails us in this regard and why you should probably still be flossing.

The Cracked Podcast,146,The 2nd Annual Cracked Podcast Halloween Spooktacular,2016-10-17,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-2nd-annual-cracked-podcast-halloween-spooktacular/,"Last Halloween (https://goo.gl/Eu1CJU) we spooked you with  a melange of real-life horror stories that had little explanation. There was the dead girl who was found in a water tower above the hotel where she went missing. Security tapes were inconclusive, except for one minor detail: it appeared as if she was hiding and running away from…absolutely nothing. Was it a ghost? An inter-dimensional monster? A coked-up Harry Potter in his invisibility cloak? We have no idea. Scary.
There was also the story of Major Henry Rathbone, the unfortunate fellow who took the invitation of Abraham Lincoln to see a play at Ford’s Theater. Rathbone was so wracked by guilt over Lincoln’s death that he straight-up turned into Jack Nicholson in ‘The Shining’ and slaughtered his whole family. Horrifying.
So in anticipation of All Hallow’s Eve, Jack O’Brien is joined by first time co-host Nick Mundy as well as Cracked’s Carmen Angelica and Josh Sargent and comedians Eric Lampaert, Ryan Singer and Anna Seregina to share more macabre and strange stories that actually happened. They’ll discuss the thousands of missing people in our national parks and why the government may be covering it up, the French impostor who killed his entire family, the scary clowns that are tormenting America right now, the French Jack the Ripper and the famous serial killer H.H. Holmes, who may be the actual Jack the Ripper.

The Cracked Podcast,147,Dark Secrets from the Teacher’s Lounge,2016-10-19,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/dark-secrets-from-the-teachers-lounge/,"Did you ever have the sneaking suspicion that when your history teacher rolled out the old A/V cart for movie time that he was completely hungover? Or that that one teacher who seemed to hate you on a molecular level was giving you bad grades on purpose? Chances are you were right and we have the evidence to prove it: full admissions of guilt from actual teachers. Suck it, Mr. McKinley!
Yes, we got real (and anonymous) teachers to come on the podcast and dish the dirt about the real behind-the-scenes of this supposedly squeaky-clean profession. Spoiler alert: teachers are all hot messes.
Interviewing our panel of masked and maybe inebriated educators, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked’s Soren Bowie and Daniel O’Brien as well as Andrew Orvedahl and Maria Thayer from truTV’s hilarious show ‘Those Who Can’t’. They share some all-too-common stories about teachers sleeping with their students, some tips for spotting the teacher who’s secretly living at the school and why the teachers who instruct the youngest grades are the most likely to be drunk. Catch ‘Those Who Can’t’ Thursdays on truTV.","Maria Thayer, Andrew Orvedahl, Soren Bowie, Daniel O'Brien"
The Cracked Podcast,148,Trump Country: What The Media Doesn’t Want You To Know,2016-10-24,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/trump-country/,"You thought it would disappear before the Iowa primary. You thought it would surely never happen when its tax returns were released. You definitely thought it was going away as it drove past you on an ‘Access Hollywood’ tour bus. But it’s finally here. We’re doing a Trump podcast! Please hide your women and children.
We’ve actually kind of skirted around Trump a lot in the last year. We talked about the class divide in America, how it’s not necessarily driven by money and how the Donald personifies the hopes and desires of the “lower class”. We even talked about narcissism as America’s mental disorder, symbolized again by king narcissist himself, Donald J. Trump.
So this week, Crooked Jack O’Brien is joined by Lyin’ Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) in hopefully our final Trumpcast. They take one last look at Mr. Tinyfingers by looking at the 40% or so of people who are voting for him in a couple weeks no matter what. It’s easy to pass them off as toothless rednecks, racist uncles and cartoonish extras from Daily Show segments, but they are real people who didn’t come to support Trump out of nowhere. This cultural shift has been hiding in plain sight and the only problem was the left hadn’t even bothered to look. By really dissecting the reasons for this social chasm, we’ll prove that even the craziest of Trump supporters should actually be listened to, no matter how orange and absurd their political mouthpiece is.

But what about his other 12 novels and the dozens of short stories and other works you’re not familiar with?
The Cracked Podcast is going to mix it up this week with an introduction to our new Vonnegut book club, a brand new podcast with Alex Schmidt and Michael Swaim, the Kurt Vonneguys. Once a month, Alex and Michael will work through the Vonnegut library, dissecting the recurring themes and characters, highlighting some amazing Kurt-isms and providing a general overview of Kurt’s work as the connective tissue to modern sci-fi.
In this week’s episode, Alex and Michael cover Vonnegut’s overlooked first novel, ‘Player Piano,’ a satirical ‘1984’-esque warning about the horrors of automation. When you’re through, you can check out episode two of Kurt Vonneguys here (https://goo.gl/dtD9Qz), where they look at Vonnegut’s masterwork, ‘The Sirens of Titan.’ And if you’re interested in following future episodes of Kurt Vonneguys, be sure to subscribe here (https://goo.gl/yjfNTM).

The Cracked Podcast,150,Why A Second Civil War Is Frighteningly Possible,2016-11-07,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-a-second-civil-war-is-frighteningly-possible/,"“Our way of life here is about nine meals away from anarchy.” That’s a quote from retired Marine Colonel David Couvillon, who governed the Wasit province of Iraq during the US occupation and clearly a man who has never seen the Cracked office when our daily lunch of filet mignon and caviar is fifteen minutes late. His experiences in Iraq mean he knows a thing or two about modern political unrest and civil war, which makes that quote even more terrifying.
As you might’ve heard, there’s an election tomorrow (if you’re reading this day it’s coming out), and no matter what the outcome, a portion of the country is going to feel like they’ve had it stolen from them. Matt Bevins, the Governor of Kentucky, has already promised that, “blood will be shed” if Hillary wins and there’s no doubt real people are taking promises like these to heart.
So how likely is it that America falls into a second civil war? What would that look like? That’s what we’re asking Cracked’s Robert Evans and Teresa Lee on this episode of The Cracked Podcast. They’ll explain to us that violent unrest on American soil is a lot more possible than you think and that it wouldn’t be North vs. South or Red vs. Blue, but a war fought on thousands of different sides.
Also, make sure to catch the next LIVE taping of The Cracked Podcast, this Saturday, November 12th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, CA. Jack O’Brien, Daniel O’Brien and Michael Swaim will be joined by an expert in psychology to talk about some of the psychological myths everyone seems to believe: like Rorschach tests (sorry, they don’t work), middle child syndrome (not real); and depression (totally real, but antidepressants might not actually work very well).

It’s going to be okay. Sit down, have a cookie, breathe into this bag and put on your mandatory ‘Make America Great Again’ baseball cap. We’ll survive this, right?
Despite the sun coming up in the morning and life seemingly going on like normal, the world might’ve been forever changed last night. So we needed to break the little glass box, pull the lever and record an emergency podcast. Jack O’Brien is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to make sense of what happened at the polls last night, why we should’ve seen it coming from a mile away and what we can actively do to prevent this from happening again. As Jason says on the site today, “Do the opposite of Panic. Work through the problem.” It’ll all be okay.

Your obvious next step is to travel to April 20th,1889 and throw baby hitler down a well and then blow up the well,  right? Or is there something better you could do with your time?
The whole ‘would you kill baby Hitler’ thought experiment has been a surprisingly prevalent pop-culture moral question at dinner parties and bad games of Cards Against Humanity. Even Jeb Bush weighed in with his thoughts back in a simpler time when he thought he could be president. His answer, by the way, was, “hell yeah!” (https://goo.gl/IzBaxA).
This got us thinking, what would be some other moments in history to travel back to and change one thing? One answer might be incredibly simple: November 8th, 2016. Who wouldn’t go back in time to stop the events of last Tuesday? Only time will tell if that day becomes one of the giant crossroads in the slow forward march of history.
So today Jack O’Brien and Alex Schmidt are posing that question to our five comedian guests: Steven Wilbur, Riley Silverman, Caitlin Gill, Blake Wexler and Eric Lampaert. When would you go in history to change one thing, what would it be and why?

The Cracked Podcast,153,Dispelling Every Space Myth You Learned In 7th Grade Science,2016-11-21,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/dispelling-every-space-myth-you-learned-in-7th-grade-science/,"Believe it or not, Matthew McConaughey’s thesis (from behind a bookshelf inside a black hole) that love is the most powerful force in the universe isn’t the most scientifically accurate thing Hollywood has offered us lately. It should come as no surprise that movies take a lot of liberties with astrophysics and what is possible or impossible in the realm of outer space. Like, sending up a crew of men less qualified than Donald Trump (too soon?) to blow up an asteroid? That’s probably not in NASA’s Plans A through “we ran out of letters” of how to stop a meteor on a collision course with Earth. 
Even in more fantastical movies like the Star Wars or Star Trek films, you just get very inadequate image in your head of how space works. Take asteroid belts, for example. It’s a belt! Made of asteroids! Asteroids as far as the eye can see! You can’t safely pilot your ship through them because there are just so many damn asteroids! I’ve had it with these motherf**king asteroids on this motherf**king belt! 
We’re sorry to say that’s now how the asteroid belt works at all. The average distance between bodies in the asteroid belt is 600,000 miles, which is more than double the distance between the Earth and the Moon. So traveling through the asteroid belt is less dodging asteroids like Han Solo and more, “we passed through the asteroid belt?” To dispel some more myths about how space works, Jack O’Brien and Alex Schmidt are joined by Dr. Farah Alibay, a real life scientist at JPL who gets to play with styrofoam models of planets all day and is currently working on a mission that’s trying to scoop a 2o-ton boulder off an asteroid, which is as cool as it sounds.

The Cracked Podcast,154,14 Psych Myths We Learned From Movies That Are Totally False,2016-11-28,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/14-psych-myths-we-learned-from-movies-that-are-totally-false/,"It’s pretty safe to say that after years of Sherlock Holmes adaptations and countless CBS crime procedurals (he was the supreme leader of a cult, but now he’s leading the Supreme Court!) most people with a pretty steady diet of TV and movies think they’re pretty good armchair psychologists.
If you learn of a prison riot on the news, you’ll cite the Stanford prison experiment and claim that we’re all just a baton and a uniform away from turning into monsters. If the news later reports of a man who stabbed his mother, you’ll find a Freudian explanation for the crime that speaks of Oedipal repressed sexuality and the phallic nature of stabbings. 
Bad news: turns out everything you learned about psychology from the shiny little box in the center of your living room isn’t totally accurate. Not only do movies and TV shows take giant liberties with how psychology works, the psych field itself has a hard time getting out of its own way: studies can be biased for multiple reasons, the replication crisis impedes the verification of discoveries and news outlets only report on the grabbiest psych headlines and and skew the truth.
So on this week’s podcast, we’re putting a bunch of psych myths in a straight jacket, tossing them in a padded room and throwing away the key. Cracked’s Jack O’Brien, Daniel O’Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Peter McGraw, an expert in behavioral science and a marketing and psychology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. They dispel pop-psych stories like the Milgram experiment, power posing and the Mozart effect.
Also make sure to buy tickets to our next LIVE podcast taping on Saturday, December 10th at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, California. Jack and the crew will be giving a much needed, “good riddance” to the year 2016 with our annual Year In Review In Review.

The Cracked Podcast,155,Lives Trump Has Promised To Ruin In His First 100 Days,2016-12-05,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/lives-trump-has-promised-to-ruin-in-his-first-100-days/,"In the past few weeks, we’ve written about not panicking, why you should absolutely panic, and just about everything in between when it comes to the Trump presidency. One thing we haven’t quite touched on yet is how real life actual people will be affected by the changes he promised to make during his campaign. 
One thing Trump already promised to do is repeal an Obama executive order called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  DACA allows children who were brought here illegally (keyword: children) to gain somewhat-legal status; protection from deportation, a social security card, in exchange for staying out of trouble and being an active part of the workforce. These are law-abiding, tax-paying young adults whose home country for all intents and purposes is America. A lot of them don’t even know the know the language spoken in their country of origin. The shittiest thing is these people might be the first to be deported because they had the unmitigated gall to actively try to live in the United States legally.
Robert Evans and Tom Reimann grab the reigns of the podcast this week and have conversations with a potential victim of the removal of DACA, a transgender woman whose medications may no longer be covered, and an army vet whose parents are immigrants to talk about the scary world they’ve been suddenly thrust into. Later a British journalist joins to talk about the parallels to Brexit and why we might soon see fascist vs. anti-fascist fighting in the streets, and how it could look.

The Cracked Podcast,156,Movies That Teach Men Horrible Lessons About Sex,2016-12-12,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/movies-that-teach-men-horrible-lessons/,"You know how when you watch and old movie and there’s a Y2K joke or a WAZZZZUUUP and you think, “man, this hasn’t aged well.” There’s now a whole category of those movies that are just classically heroic dudes being absolute dicks to women. There’s even a whole supercut (https://goo.gl/ejmmDH)  of all the times James Bond hits women. Just Sean Connery slapping women left and right like he’s Moe and every Bond girl is Larry and Curly.
Now, hear us out on this, but there’s a chance that images like this might have been hurting women instead of helping them. Crazy. Maybe normalizing violence against women or showing Harrison Ford literally whipping (https://goo.gl/QRB2Gw)  Kate Capshaw into kissing him have given men unrealistic ideas about how things like consent work.
This week Jack O’Brien brings on Carmen Angelica, Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Katy Stoll to talk about the modern-day minefield of consent, what movies have been getting wrong about it, why it’s so easy for guys to get defensive about it and a female perspective on why it’s so damn important.

The Cracked Podcast,157,2016 Year In Review In Review,2016-12-19,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/2016-year-in-review-in-review/,"2016 is almost over. Yes the endless, rotten sh*t hurricane of a year that took away
Bowie, Prince and Florence Henderson and gave us Trump, Harambe and the Zika virus is finally drawing to a close. 
So, to give this b*tch a proper viking funeral, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked’s Cody Johnston, Daniel O’Brien and Alex Schmidt and comedian Caitlin Gill to review our culture’s year-in-review process. 
They’ll also shine a much needed light on some of the more overlooked stories from the year. For example, two-headed sharks keep appearing in our oceans and no one knows why. Even all the world’s Bond villains are like, “don’t look at us, we thought that was you.” And Kim Kardashian! It feels like she’s been on every magazine cover for the last 35 years and this year she got kidnapped at gunpoint and it barely raised an eyebrow. What is going on!?
To wrap up the conversation, Jack and company share some of their favorite cultural things from the year and report from the future with a preview of our 2017 year in review.

The Cracked Podcast,158,The 25 Coolest Things We Discovered In 2016,2016-12-26,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-25-coolest-things-we-discovered-in-2016/,"It’s not just us right? There are too many damn movies and TV shows to keep up with. When we’re not in the middle of a season of Game of Thrones, Westworld, Silicon Valley, Stranger Things, or House of Cards, there are always 40 other shows just waiting to get started. If only you were ready to make the commitment. Your girlfriend wants you to propose but you can’t even commit to Six Feet Under, let alone the next 60 years of your life.
This glut of TV shows we’re experiencing completely fails to lack the steady stream of quality movies coming out not only in the US but all around the world. And the surplus of movies doesn’t even address how behind you are on music. Open up Spotify or look at the next festival lineup and you can barely recognize a third of the bands there. And we’re not being old fogies complaining about music these days– most of these bands are good– we just can’t keep up with them. 21 Pilots, 21 Savage, 21 Scarecrows. Only one of those band names is completely made up.
So to give a little order to this exponentially insane world, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to talk about some of their favorite they discovered in 2016. They commiserate about the superabundance of content and Soren gives some completely unsolicited home improvement advice.
Our next live podcast is on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark from ‘My Favorite Murder’ are back for another hour of creepy unsolved murders and even creepier solved ones.

The Cracked Podcast,159,The 80s: Our Most Bizarre Decade (Is Happening Again),2017-01-02,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-80s-our-most-bizarre-decade-is-happening-again/,"Name the year: a new Star War is killing it at the box office, Russia and the US are having a staring contest and a madman driven by the power of celebrity is elected President. Yes, it’s looking very much like we’re living in the year 1980 right now and we want it to stop. I mean, if this is 1980, that means we’re only three years away from more Ewoks. Although what is a Minion but yellow Ewok?
But in all seriousness, the world has taken a turn for the conservative as it did in the early 80s. Free love and long hair were gone and replaced by shoulder pads, cocaine and rich white kids who thought the stock market was dope. So is there anything redeemable about this situation other than the prospect of getting some cool movies and punk music?
Jack O’Brien and Daniel O’Brien are joined by comedian, podcast host and ‘Saved by the Bell’ historian April Richardson for a conversation about how 80s pop-culture perfectly represented those regressive times and how some of the patterns we saw then are starting to appear now in our modern pop-culture. They also talk about ‘Saved by the Bell’ a lot. Like, a whole bunch.
Our next live podcast is on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles.

The Cracked Podcast,160,Romantic Comedies: The Creepiest Movie Genre,2017-01-09,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/romantic-comedies-the-creepiest-movie-genre/,"Think of every RomCom trope and the one thing that separates it from being in a horror movie instead: the music. It’s all the same mad libs game, and the outcome is always the same.
Colin Firth/Hugh Grant/Matthew McConaughey runs to the airport/apartment building/twee bakery to declare his undying love for the maid/undercover journalist/baker he just met last week. The music swells, they kiss, the girl’s less attractive best friend sighs, “oh I wish architect/surgeon/astronaut Chet Wellington could fall in love with me,” and the credits roll. But what if, instead of the swelling music, it was a single piano note being played backwards, or an old-timey phonograph blowing out a single child singing, “Ring Around the Rosie?” ‘Love Actually’ would turn into an actual horror movie. The little boy chasing the little girl through the airport would take on a new interpretation. ‘Shining 2: This Time It’s British Christmas.”
RomComs are weird like that. They take a thing most people experience (falling in love) and turn it into a warped version of reality that only abides by backwards rules: where chasing someone down is considered romantic and getting the person to like you is the hardest part, not that whole spending the next 5 decades together thing. No, that part is easy (cries self to sleep).
So this week on the podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editor Soren Bowie and comedian and writer Jamie Loftus from ‘The Bechdel Cast’ to talk about how RomComs get almost everything wrong and when you change just one detail, they become creepy stalker thrillers.
Our next live podcast is on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark from ‘My Favorite Murder’ are back for another hour of creepy unsolved murders and even creepier solved ones. Tickets are currently SOLD OUT but more will be released throughout the week  here: https://goo.gl/5eew6F . If the show remains sold out, we will have a standby list at the door, so make sure to come early!

The Cracked Podcast,161,Accidents That Created The Best Art Of The 20th Century,2017-01-16,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/accidents-that-created-the-best-art-of-the-20th-century/,"It’s easy to think every piece of great art or unforgettable pop-culture is the result of effortless genius and precise intentionality. It separates the gods who create from us lay-people who like to eat cheese and can barely decide what to watch on Netflix. Take Spock’s “Live Long and Prosper” hand signal. Yeah, it seems a little trivial, it’s not ‘Starry Night’ or ‘Hey Jude’ or anything, but it’s an icon that’s lasted in the popular culture for 50 years and stands only second to “May the Force be with you” as the most recognizable totem of the sci-fi genre. Only a genius could’ve come up with that, right? Not really. Gene Roddenberry and company wanted the Vulcan salute to be the peace sign until Lenoard Nimoy took a stand for what was right and was like, “hey, this is dumb. I know this is coming from the dude wearing pointy ears right now, but can I just try this other thing so I don’t look like the stupidest person on television?”
And thank god Nimoy did that, because otherwise everyone would’ve thought ‘Star Trek’ was cheesy crap, or at least cheesier than it already was considered. So sometimes genius isn’t in the intention as much as it is being able to realize a mistake, correct it and pray to god your new solution isn’t as dull as the idea that preceded it. And pop culture is so littered with examples like these, there’s a lone Native American man shedding a single tear over it. That much litter.
So Jack O’Brien is joined on the podcast this week by Cracked’s Teresa Lee and Alex Schmidt to talk about the behind the scenes mistakes and last-minute casting changes that made some movies and video games better. They also talk about some ghastly original versions of famous scripts that thankfully never saw the light of day. You don’t want to know what the original description of Han Solo was (hint: it included the words “green” and “gills”).

The Cracked Podcast,162,9 Creepy Real Murders (With ‘My Favorite Murder’),2017-01-23,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/9-creepy-real-murders-with-my-favorite-murder/,"Remember when you made fun of that kid in grade school for wetting the bed? You probably shouldn’t have done that. I would apologize, change your name or leave the country. The reason is, psychologists suggest something called the Macdonald triangle, that there are three main characteristics of people who grow up to become killers: arson, cruelty to animals and bed-wetting. If you’ve got two or more, (in Jeff Foxworthy’s voice) chances are you might be a serial killer.
So, for another round of creepy solved and unsolved murders, we’ve invited back to the podcast America’s foremost experts on the subject, Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark from ‘My Favorite Murder’. They join Jack O’Brien and Daniel O’Brien to talk about Daniel’s two hometown serial killers with a strange connection, two district attorneys who suffered mysterious ends, the unsolved murder of three girl scouts, and the murderer who buried his “kill kits” in the woods.

The Cracked Podcast,163,The Enormous Lie About Modern Life (You Likely Believe),2017-01-30,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-enormous-lie-about-modern-life-you-likely-believe/,"Once you hit your mid-twenties, everything starts beginning to suck. Your favorite band? Not as good as when they first came out. Favorite hangouts? All gone to shit since all the young people started showing up and ruining everything. The world? Basically a day away from total anarchy.
Even the idea of time begins to suck. The present is somehow always the worst and no matter how bad your life was 5, 10 years ago– it all seems tinted with rose-colored glasses. Sure you were bored all the time, had no way of communicating with people who weren’t your neighbors and loved Hootie and the Blowfish, but man the 90s were the absolute peak of human existence, right? Not really.
Somehow humans have this bias that makes them think the world is always at the brink of complete collapse and that things were better before…before AIDS and Ebola started killing everybody; before all the bees disappeared; before crime took over the streets, when you could leave your front door open all day and the criminals would tip their hats and say, “good morning!”
We’re here to say this way of thinking is wrong and completely ignores all of the amazing advancements humanity is continuing to make every day. It’s just you don’t hear about them because the headline “Cancer Deaths Slowly and Steadily Dropping” isn’t as flashy as “IT’S ALL BURNING DOWN MAN, DON’T EVEN BOTHER!”
On the podcast this week, Jack O’Brien is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to talk about how we’re neither going to hell nor are we in a hand basket. Poverty, war and disease are at all time lows, all you have to do is look away from the news to see it.
Our next live podcast is on Saturday, February 11th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Just in time for Valentine’s Day, join Jack O’Brien, Michael Swaim and Teresa Lee as they welcome Dr. Christopher Ryan, author of Sex at Dawn for a discussion about love, relationships and why our sex lives now bear no resemblance to the way our ancestors got down.

Not since the Cold War has Russophobia been as much of a part of our daily lives as it is now. Disinformation, strong man tactics and a corrupt and dictatorial turn have spilled into American life in a way that would’ve seemed like fiction only a few decades ago. What was once the well-trodden territory of black and white “duck and cover” videos and 80s action flicks is now a staple of Twitter feeds and nightly news broadcasts.
So how did we get here, and what the hell does Russia even want from us this time around? That’s what Cracked’s Robert Evans and Michael Swaim are here to find out on this week’s podcast. They join Jack O’Brien for an all-encompassing conversation about the KGB’s history of deceit, Russia’s methodology for spreading lies and Vlad Putin’s psych evaluation. Later in the show, Jack interviews Cracked engineer Tatiana Nam about her experiences growing up in Russia.

The Cracked Podcast,165,Jafar Is Disney Moses: Secretly Heroic Villains,2017-02-13,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/jafar-is-disney-moses-secretly-heroic-villains/,"Did you ever notice how every movie villain is just really ugly beyond belief? 
Emperor Palpatine? WRINKLED UP UGGO. 
Jafar? POINTY FACE. 
Scar? LITERALLY NAMED AFTER HIS FACIAL DEFORMITY.
It’s fucking dark when you think about how many movies this applies to; how the villain is usually someone trying to live a normal or equal life, but their ugliness just gets in the way. ‘The Incredibles’ is a perfect example. The villain is an ugly-little redhead kid who just wants for everybody to be a superhero, but the Incredibles are like NNNNNNOPE and throw him into a jet engine because only they should get to be superheroes.
Yeah, of course Syndrome kills like 30 other superheroes and sets a giant death robot loose on a major metropolis, but just go with us for this thought experiment. His heart was in the right place. On this week’s podcast Jack O’Brien welcomes Cracked’s own Katie Goldin and Michael Swaim to unpack this trope and how you can see ugly bad guys ostensibly trying to do the right thing in franchises from Disney to The Lord of the Rings.

The Cracked Podcast,166,Why Modern People Might Have The Worst Sex Lives Ever,2017-02-14,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-modern-people-might-have-the-worst-sex-lives-ever/,"When you think about ancient human history, you probably think about sex, right? Who doesn’t? And when you do, you probably imagine in your head (because you love envisioning your eldest relatives gettin’ down) a very bland, puritanical form of sex where they do it through a sheet once every other year and only to conceive, right? Well, sorry to make you throw up in your mouth a little bit, but your ideas of chastened ancestors living repressed lives are as wrong as the next images we’re about to put in your mind: ancient humans were nasty little horndogs. In fact, the basically standard modern ideas of monogamy and fidelity are extremely recent developments in human history. They’ve only been around for about 10,000 years — a blink of the evolutionary eye.
So what was the ancient hunter-gatherer love like actually like? And what can we learn about our own sex lives from looking at how the cavemen got down? A lot, actually. So we asked an expert. By studying prehistoric human cultures and the sex lives of our two closest genetic relatives, chimps and bonobos, Dr. Christopher Ryan has some pretty eye-opening stuff to share about human sexuality. So Jack O’Brien welcomes Dr. Ryan on this bonus episode of The Cracked Podcast to talk with Teresa Lee and Michael Swaim about swinging tribes-people, primitive vibrators and ape balls in a conversation that is bound to make you rethink everything you know about love and sexuality.

The Cracked Podcast,167,Cracked’s 2017 Fake Oscar Awards,2017-02-20,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/crackeds-2017-fake-oscar-awards/,"Who can forget the classic Oscars showdown between ‘The Artist’ and, uh, ‘Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close’? Most of us can and did, in fact. Great job, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences! Way to keep your fingers on the pulse of American filmmaking by giving gold out to the 1930s-style silent film. Trailblazing. 
The Oscars have proven year after year that they’re not the best barometer for judging the best or even the most popular films from a given year. Often they’re really only judging movies on the criteria of being appealing to a group of old, white men with film industry jobs. Look at three of the last five best picture winners and their subject matter: ‘Birdman’– an aging actor known for playing superheroes strives for artistic legitimacy; ‘Argo’– Hollywood producers save hostages in Iran; ‘The Artist’– Remember silent films? And let’s pencil ‘La La Land’ into that list– an struggling actress and a struggling musician fall in love, become successful. Hollywood obviously has a problem being objective about movies wherein the subject matter is itself.
So this week we’re being objective for Hollywood. Jack O’Brien welcomes Cracked’s David Bell, Adam Ganser and Brett Rader to discuss 2016’s Best Picture nominees and award movies in some made-up categories that we’d like to see incorporated into the Oscar broadcast. Later they took a look back at the 2012 Oscars in which ‘The Artist’ won best picture and redistribute the awards with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.

The Cracked Podcast,168,"Lies You Believe About Jesus, Islam And Other Religions",2017-02-27,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/lies-you-believe-about-jesus-islam-and-other-religions/,"What separates the baby religions from the big ones? Is there anything specific that makes Catholicism or Islam more important than the shrine to The Noid that I have in my closet? Some religions make you go to mass or travel to Mecca, mine makes me eat pizza in the nude at least twice a week. 
The point we’re trying to make is that what seems fringe or crazy now may have a billion devoted followers a thousand years from now. Mormonism was about as fringe as you could get a hundred years ago, less than a million followers, but now the there are around 16 million members and counting. Is there any religion that’s out there now that’s in the same place Mormonism was 100 years ago?
To get a better understanding of some of these lesser-known religions and if they’ll stand the test of time, Jack O’Brien’s guest this week is Reza Aslan, who has a PhD in the study of religion and whose new show ‘Believer’ on CNN throws him head-first into the beliefs and practices of obscure religions. Among Scientology and Santa Muerte, they talk about the implausible origins of biblical literalism, the rare disorder that has tourists in Jerusalem thinking they’re the messiah and a few big things that’ll change your notions of Christianity and Islam.

They use a special shorthand to convey ideas or explain plot in the most efficient way possible. There’s one problem though: they do it in the same couple dozen ways and recycle them over and over. And they need to stop. Or at least invent some new ones.
Is someone’s life crumbling away after a break-up? Just give them a beard and litter their apartment with Chinese food cartons. Want to show someone has a house or apartment, but no possessions? How about some well-placed Chinese food cartons? Is someone pulling an all-nighter with their work? More Chinese food cartons!
If you’re a person who even casually watches movies, you’ll know so many of these the instant we bring them up and you’ll never unsee them in any film going forward. To break down 25 of the biggest offenders, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked’s Carmen Angelica, Soren Bowie and Daniel O’Brien. They talk about how people brush their teeth in movies, how men try to steal kisses and why you can never trust a fictional male nurse.

Wake up. Open Twitter. And here come’s your fix. It’s something like, “Trump Surrogate Says Jews in the Holocaust Didn’t Have it So Bad!” and you’re off to the races. How could he!? Do they know how insensitive that is!? And so on, and so forth until tomorrow, when it’s something else. It’s the rage machine and it exists on both sides. 
For every “Trump Eats Steak Well Done With Ketchup,” you see on on the left, folks on the right will see something like “Communist Sympathizer Lena Dunham Thinks Pedophiles Should Teach Kindergarten.” And the big secret is: both sides are getting played. The nonstop outrage engine is a contrivance, a counterfeit system made by people trying to profit off notoriety, and fueled by humanity’s physiological addiction to anger. We hate it. And we love it. And we can’t fucking stop.
On this week’s podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), Katie Golden and Alex Schmidt to break-down how the non-stop rage machine works, who’s profiting from it, and why this snake eating its tail is so addictive to the human psyche.

Look at them, with their Confederate flags and voter ID laws! But while you were sleeping, the blue states were up to some pretty racist shit too. It’s just that they’ve got better PR. 
For example, one of the biggest and most violent anti-segregation fights in US history didn’t take place in 1950s Mississippi or Alabama, but 1970s Boston. The 70s! In Massachusetts! The land of Kennedys, Afflecks and liberal arts colleges was faced with the desegregation of schools and was like, “yo George Wallace, hold my beer!”
To discuss some of the secretly f#&*ed up modern history of the United States, Jack O’Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by the guys from ‘The Dollop’: Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds. They discuss the Boston busing riots of the 70s, the comically-liberal blue state with secret ties to the KKK and why we’re about to live through the Enron crisis all over again.

The Cracked Podcast,173,Marketing Lies You’ve Been Duped Into Believing,2017-03-27,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/marketing-lies-youve-been-duped-into-believing/,"We all know consciously to take advertising with a grain of salt. Those McDonald’s burgers can’t look as manicured in person the way they do in the ads. Examples like that are easy to catch. It’s harder to spot false advertising when companies are bending the truth so much, your bullshit detectors don’t know which way is up. Take Listerine mouthwash. It was originally sold as a surgical antiseptic until some ad men in the 1920s were like, “if we told everyone to wash their mouths out with this industrial cleaner every day, then we’d make so much money we could light our cigars with the cash, but how…”. The answer was in a book of medical terminology. They looked up the fanciest word for bad breath — halitosis — and made an ad campaign telling everyone it was a chronic disease with only one cure.
“Hey, sonny boy! Does your dame ever tell ya you have bad breath?”
“Why, yes mister!”
“That’s simply because you’re dying son. Say here, drink this poison, BUT SPIT IT OUT FIRST. And do it every day for the rest of your life.”
And 90 years later we still use Listerine and still think halitosis is is a disease and not just latin for brush your damn teeth.
Modern movies do this too. Sometimes if studios have a real clunker on their hands, they’ll cut a trailer that’s so unrepresentative of the movie, you would want to sue to get your money back. A lot of times this happens to children’s movies with disastrous results for the parents that think they’re about to spend 2 hours with a rapping kangaroo.
So on this week’s podcast, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked writers Carmen Angelica and JM McNab and producer Brett Rader for a discussion of horribly misleading movie trailers, straight-up advertising lies and the contemporary commercials that are messing with your perception of reality.

The Cracked Podcast,175,Commonplace Ideas Invented More Recently Than You Think,2017-04-10,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/commonplace-ideas-invented-more-recently-than-you-think/,"Nowadays, there’s a huge emphasis on eating natural foods. Staying away from GMOs, pesticides, and processed sugars is generally thought of as a good thing. Some call it the paleo diet and it’s a way to harken back to a simpler time, when our ancestors ate gathered fruits and hunted animals.
Going paleo is very noble and all, but the problem is: the plants and animals we eat are nothing like they were thousands of years ago, let a hundred years ago. Before test tubes were ever a part of the equation, we selectively bred everything from cows and chickens to apples and bananas. You’d barf in your mouth just looking at an OG banana, let alone trying to eat it. And cows? They were bred from their ancestors, cattle-like animals called aurochs, who would fuck you up if you tried milking them.
The food we eat today and think of as normal is just one example of a historical blindspot we have where we think commonplace objects and concepts have been around forever. But in this week’s episode, Jack O’Brien is joined by Michael Swaim and Teresa Lee to discuss how things like food, love, racism and mourning dead children are all surprisingly recent developments.

So yeah, it seems like for the nth summer in a row, the great minds in the Hollywood dream factory are officially out of ideas. Our question is: why? When there are so many amazing stories from real life or incredible works that have yet to be adapted, why another Transformers?
This is an issue only the After Hours crew (sans Michael) can figure out. On this week’s episode, Jack O’Brien is joined by Soren Bowie, Daniel O’Brien and Katie Willert to fix reboots, throw out adaptations and pitch unbelievable real stories that would make for incredible movies, if only Hollywood had the balls to produce them.

The Cracked Podcast,177,Why Every Billionaire Is Becoming A Doomsday Prepper,2017-04-24,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/why-every-billionaire-is-becoming-a-doomsday-prepper/,"Sometime around when Donald Trump started winning state primaries a year ago, the national mood went from, “Damn Daniel,” to “oh fuck we’re actually going to die in a rain of nuclear hellfire.” That happens when a sitting US President attacks an almost-nuclear state on Twitter, as was the case a few weekends ago.
With climate change, market instability, loss of privacy, the rise of fascism and a hair-triggered President all coming to a boil around the same time, it’s understandable for images of apocalypse and dystopia to weigh heavily on the mind.
So, this week the Cracked Podcast is doing an apocalypse grab-bag. Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked’s Alex Schmidt and Saundra Sorenson to talk about bizarre apocalypse-level events that already happened and stories from places like Nigeria, Iraq, the Philippines and even Canada, where either natural disaster, terrorism or totalitarian government have turned everyday life into a dystopia.

The Cracked Podcast,178,23 Convoluted Movie Schemes That Need A Second Look,2017-05-01,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/23-convoluted-movie-schemes-that-need-a-second-look/,"The term ‘movie magic’ typically refers to the technical brilliance of bringing dinosaurs to life onscreen or how Denzel Washington can make an entire theatre of men and women pregnant with a single knowing glance. But there’s a second type of movie magic that often goes overlooked: when movies are so good, we don’t notice when their characters’ plans’ make absolutely no sense. 
All the great ones do this. In ‘Return of the Jedi’, all of the main characters get captured attempting to break Han Solo out of Jabba’s palace, but it’s all good because that was seemingly their plan all along? Why wait to get captured when you can just drop in, lightsabers blazing, bust your dude out of the carbonite and smoke fools in an epic prison breakout? Seems like Luke wanted to fight the Rancor all along.
There’s a whole category of these where bad guys try to weaponize monsters. From the ‘Alien’ series to ‘Jurassic World’, it’s just a bad idea. 
Christopher Nolan is a real magician when it comes to bad movie plans. ‘The Dark Knight’, ‘The Dark Knight Rises’, and ‘The Prestige’ all have glaring examples of movie schemes that don’t hold up under an ounce of scrutiny.
So, join Jack O’Brien, Michael Swaim, and David Christopher Bell as they discuss the failing of Nolan’s villains, why ‘Westworld’ makes no sense, and how the dudes in ‘Jaws’ had a bigger boat the whole damn time.
And make sure to get tickets to our next LIVE Cracked Podcast, coming up on Saturday, May 13th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles.

Every few months some retiring journalist, former tech-mogul or aspiring Tomi Lahren-type goes viral because they’ve had it up to *here* with these gosh darn millennials. Between their clamoring for single-payer healthcare and their complaining about unpaid internships, it’s like they hate America or something. Why can’t they appreciate what they’ve got and be exactly what the generation before wants them to be?
We’ve heard it a million times and, frankly, it’s all bullshit. You know how we know? Because every generation has been lodging the same 4 complaints about their successors since the beginning of the written language (and probably before that too). Grug and all the other teens don’t care about hunting mammoths like their fathers, they just sit around playing with those newfangled *wheels* all day. As long as we keep having kids, this will happen until the end of time.
On this week’s podcast, resident Gen-X’er-in-chief Jack O’Brien welcomes young upstarts Katie Goldin, Brett Rader and Josh Sargent onto the show to discuss why this never-ending argument is bullshit. They discuss some flaws in logic behind popular anti-millennial rants and call out some shady statistics that news outlets circulate to prop-up these arguments.

The Cracked Podcast,180,More Simpsons Writer’s Room Stories (From A Simpsons Writer),2017-05-15,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/more-simpsons-writers-room-stories-from-a-simpsons-writer/,"Dana Gould is one of comedy’s “that guys.” His footprint is everywhere — from writing on top-line hits like The Simpsons to cult-status titles The Ben Stiller Show — and there’s a chance you’ve never heard of him. If you’re like Dana and you’ve spent the last quarter century hopping from great writers room to great writers room, while still managing to be a stand-up, a podcast host, and the voice of an animated gecko (not that one), you gain insights into life, entertainment and politics that a lot of us aren’t privy to.
So on this week’s podcast, Jack O’Brien, Daniel O’Brien and Michael Swaim sit down with Dana for an extended conversation about the world-building processes behind The Simpsons and Parks & Rec, Elvis Costello’s worst night ever, and the cognitive dissonance of the average Trump supporter. We also ask him about Gex.

But hold onto your molly water, legal marijuana and fidget spinners, kids: history is as shitfaced wasted as any frat party or music festival, you just have to dig a little deep to find it. Also, it’s hard for high school history teachers to talk about how great Ulysses S. Grant was and talk about how drunk he was the whole civil war. So they just don’t mention that last part. American hero!
In this week’s episode, Jack O’Brien is joined by Cracked’s Carmen Angelica, Alex Schmidt and Michael Swaim, as well as comedian Blake Wexler, for a deep dive into some of history’s most secretly inebriated moments. They’ll talk about wars that were almost started and wars that were ended thanks to booze, some surprisingly great accomplishments powered by LSD (please don’t try them at home) and the American president who was so drunk all the time, it sort of puts the whole Trump presidency into horrifying perspective.

And we’re not talking about overthrowing the government or anything, we just mean basic things like how we take out our trash, when we vote and what movies we like to see when.
Think about it, why do all the big action-tentpole movies come out in the summer? Is it because kids are out of school? Beauty and the Beast has made a half-billion dollars domestically but it came out in March. If the next Spiderman came out in February, would nobody see it? Of course people would, so again, why all the big movies in the Summer?
This week on the podcast we’re asking questions like these to some of the big staples of modern living. Jack O’Brien is joined by Adam Ganser and Alex Schmidt. They ask if there’s a better way we can be voting, doing taxes and disposing of our trash, and make simple tweaks to improve professional sports, comic book movies and the 5-day work week.

But there is some hope. As one of our guests puts it, “Rome wasn’t burnt down in a day.” Despite your Richard Spencers, your animated frog avatars and the whole extended cast of characters hell-bent on returning America to its pre-civil rights glory (“a hot dog cost a nickel and you could physically assault any person of color you saw! “) there are still people fighting for good in this country.
That’s why this week we’re chatting with comedians/podcasters/activists and all-around cool dudes W. Kamau Bell and Hari Kondabolu. Their podcast “Politically Reactive” is the modern guide to surviving in the age of Trump– from how to be an active part of the resistance to just how to stay happy and not let the whole dumpster fire weigh you down on a day-to-day basis. First, Jack O’Brien and Daniel O’Brien chat with W. Kamau Bell about his show “United Shades of America,” what it was like interviewing Richard Spencer and a KKK leader and how he would go about fixing the violence in Chicago. Later, Alex Schmidt and Katie Goldin speak with Hari Kondabolu about #covfefe, how being a touring comedian gives you a different view of America and an absolutely crazy video of Malcom X on a Canadian Game show.

We as the audience know: IT’S NOT HIM, IT’S HIS EVIL TWIN! SEND HIM BACK FROM WHENCE HE CAME!
Again, it’s easy to spot this from a mile away when you see it on a soap opera or a children’s cartoon. The crazy thing is, whether you know it or not, every movie and TV show uses a special shorthand to convey if a character is good, evil, happy, sad, trustworthy or complicated. And more often than not, this shorthand is baked into how a character presents themselves. You just need to know what to look for. 
That’s why in our new podcast mini-series sponsored by Dollar Shave Club, Cracked senior editor Soren Bowie and head of video Daniel O’Brien will dissect how characters’ grooming habits, costumes and make-up are the biggest spoilers of all. This week on episode one, the guys will take a look at Superman’s dueling hair styles, what different types of facial hair say and what it means when a character chooses to be bald.

Every movie from The Godfather II to Joe Dirt 2 is the result of years and years of tireless hard work from artists, craftsmen, teamsters, executives and advertisers– all working in high pressure situations with tight deadlines, huge egos and insane amounts of money at play. Like GDP of a small island nation amount of money.
Odds are behind every movie, there’s an absolutely insane story of inappropriate behavior, blatant disregard for safety regulations and famous people trying to murder each other. This week on the podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked’s Daniel O’Brien and Tom Reimann, comedian Jamie Loftus and writer Dave Schilling (The Guardian, Bleacher Report, Vice) to cover 17 movies with absolutely batsh*t behind the scenes stories, like basically every late-period Marlon Brando movie, the screwball comedy that shot an iconic scene on 9/11 and the backstage antics that led a very famous actor to punch James Cameron in the face.

If Harry looked like Gary Oldman in ‘Hannibal’, Hermione and Ron be afraid to talk to him and even the Dementors would think twice before getting close to him. But Harry’s scar is pencil-thin, and hides behind his hair. He’s got a good-guy scar. And characters like Heath Ledger’s Joker, Freddy Krueger and Scar? Obviously bad guys, right? ‘The Lion King’ wasn’t even trying when they named their bad guy.
Last week, in episode one of “Looking the Part,” Soren Bowie and Daniel O’Brien analyzed what filmmakers were subtly telegraphing to audiences with characters’ hair, mustaches and beards. This week the guys are joined by costume designer Jenna Wright to take a look at the skin, how scars and tattoos are used on good guys vs. bad guys, and the role costuming plays in developing a character.

Before kids got the summer off, school basically was the break from months of grueling farm work or any of the other countless horrors we subjected children to before modern labor laws. As people moved out of farming jobs into the cities and modes of transportation out of the cities became cheaper and more efficient, the travel and recreation industry took flight. 
By the end of the twentieth century, resort towns, roadside attractions and theme parks were a main staple of the summer vacation and a huge source of money for local economies. Or at least the ones you’ve heard of were.
On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked writers and editors David Christopher Bell and Tom Reimann to discuss the origins of the summer break, how Disneyland was built, and a weird catalogue of failed theme parks lost to history.
And if you’re in Los Angeles in July, make sure to come to our next live podcast taping. On Saturday July 8th at 7:00pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre, former zoo tour guide and current Cracked Podcast host Alex Schmidt will be joined by Cracked’s Daniel O’Brien and Katie Goldin as well as comedians Caitlin Gill, Joey Clift and Matt Kirshen as they discuss snakes, hippos, octopuses and every other animal that could Planet-0f-the-Apes us if they tried.

Also, be sure to get caught-up on our Cracked Podcast mini-series ‘Looking the Part’ co-hosted by Soren Bowie and Daniel O’Brien. Each Friday, Soren and Daniel are taking a deep-dive into the theories and hidden meanings behind movie hair, costumes and make-up. They examine the cryptic psychological reason behind Superman’s dueling haircuts, why Ledger’s Joker has scars and Leto’s Joker has tattoos and a whole lot more.

In some order, you shower, use the toilet, shave and brush your teeth. In that respect, movie characters don’t seem to exist in the same universe as us. Typically we only see them there if something important is happening, like if someone is taking a shower at the Bates Motel or if Danny Glover needs to use the toilet in ‘Lethal Weapon 2’.
In part-three of our special mini-series ‘Looking the Part’, Soren Bowie and Daniel O’Brien break down the typical bathroom tropes we see all over pop-culture, from the different varieties of the scary shower sequence, to the strange way shaving is used to show a power imbalance. They’re joined by screenwriter Seth W. Owen to break-down how a writer implements these types of scenes and to discuss the crazy reason so many movies have a part where the hero washes his face and then takes a long, steely look in the mirror.

The Cracked Podcast,190,20 Unheralded Geniuses Who Basically Invented Modern Movies,2017-07-03,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/20-unheralded-geniuses-who-basically-invented-modern-movies/,"For many people, filmmaking begins and ends with the director. We call it a director’s medium. It’s their vision that guides the entire production and it’s their name that gets the praise when a movie is good, and gets dragged through the mud when a movie stinks. While that’s somewhat accurate, it’s completely forgetting about the hundreds of artists, technicians, producers and craftsmen who bring equal skill to the table and without whom our favorite movies would be totally different.
Take Tim Burton, for example. His films have a “look,” right? Edward Scissorhands, Pee-Wee’s Great Adventure and Beetlejuice sort of exemplify Burton taking atomic age nostalgia and running it through the prism of Dr. Seuss on acid. Burton gets the credit for it, but all of those films (and a huge swath more) were art designed by the same guy, Rick Heinrichs. Without Heinrich’s input, who knows what those movies would look like or if any of them would be as instantly memorable as they are now.
Alex Schimdt welcomes Michael Swaim and Matt Gourley (Superego, I Was There Too, James Bonding) to talk about people like Heinrichs. Unknown artists who have had as much of a guiding hand in modern cinema as your Spielbergs, Lucases and Scorseses, but who you’ve never heard of.

The Cracked Podcast,191,How Jaws And Alien Invented The Summer Blockbuster,2017-07-10,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-jaws-and-alien-invented-the-summer-blockbuster/,"Big cardboard cutouts in movie theater lobbies. Promotional cups at fast food restaurants. Kickass soundtracks featuring Seal. These things were once not part of our summer movie lexicon. And in the case of the tie-in song from Seal, they sadly haven’t been for about twenty years.
Somewhere between the release of Jaws in 1975 and the mid-80s, the summer movie became it’s own genre. Not specifically action, horror, sci-fi or comedy, it can’t be placed into it’s own single category, but much like the Supreme Court’s views on pornography, you know it when you see it. There are certain movies like Jurassic Park, E.T., and even Guardians of the Galaxy, where they just make you feel like summer.
So, in anticipation of the launch of Cracked’s new podcast, Cracked Movie Club, Alex Schmidt is welcoming on the show’s two hosts, Tom Reimann and Abe Epperson for an ode to the summer movie. They trace the summer movie’s origins in the seventies through to the state of the summer movie today, and then crown one film the best summer movie of all time.

The Cracked Podcast,192,Cracked Movie Club: Raiders of the Lost Ark,2017-07-13,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/cracked-movie-club-raiders-of-the-lost-ark/,"Starting today, Cracked is increasing its podcasting output by 50%! In addition to new episodes of The Cracked Podcast every Monday and Kurt Vonneguys every third Tuesday, we’re proud to launch Cracked Movie Club, which can be beamed directly into your earballs every Thursday.
Each month, your hosts Tom Reimann and Abe Epperson are choosing a new director and doing deep-dives into four of their films with some of your favorite comedians, writers and Cracked personalities. First director: Steven Spielberg.
To celebrate the launch, Cracked Movie Club is taking over The Cracked Podcast feed for the day so you can hear the inaugural episode. Tom and Abe are joined by comedian Daniel Van Kirk as they discuss how poisonous snakes, punishing desert sands, an outbreak of what can only be considered a modern plague, and a grown man pooping his pants all came together to create Raiders of the Lost Ark. Along the way, they question whether Jones was ultimately a better name than Smith, the logistics of maintaining a puzzle tomb in the middle of a jungle, and whether a certain Disney prince made a depressing cameo appearance.
And if one episode wasn’t enough for you, chaos theory is working in your favor, because episode two is available right now. Grab some fossilized mosquitos, a tub of ice cream and strap yourself in with the two female ends of a seatbelt, because Tom, Abe and Cracked’s David Christopher Bell dissect Spielberg’s 1993 hit, Jurassic Park.

The Cracked Podcast,193,How Would You Adjust If The Internet Just Went Away?,2017-07-17,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-would-you-adjust-if-the-internet-just-went-away/,"All the hip young kids are using a thing called the internet these days. In fact, if you’re reading this summary or listening to this episode, odds are you’re using the internet right now. But what if it all just went away? No podcasts, no turn-by-turn directions, no swiping for romantic partners, hell, most of us wouldn’t even have jobs if there were no internet (see: everyone at Cracked).
It’s an interesting thought experiment to…think about…and experiment on. What would you do for a living; how would you get by day-to-day without the comfort, the convenience, the necessity of the internet?
Alex Schmidt and Kristi Harrison ask the Cracked staff that very question in this episode. They chat with Abe Epperson, Tom Reimann, Ann Smiley, Saundra Sorenson and Brett Rader about the unthinkable–how could we live 21st century life without the internet?

Same goes for insects right? Kill the queen and the ant hill or bee’s nest goes away. Sounds good, unless you’re dealing with Argentine ants, who have about 300 queens for every 1,000 worker ants. 
How do you kill them? 
You don’t.
Where do they live? Probably Argentina, right? 
Wrong, they’ve taken over just about every continent other than Antarctica. So good luck with your new insect overlords.
On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked’s Katie Goldin and Daniel O’Brien, as well as comedians Joey Clift, Caitlin Gill and Matt Kirshen to discuss ants, crows, cats, immortal jellyfish and 7 other species whose crazy abilities will allow them to take over the world once us humans are gone.

The Cracked Podcast,195,Checking In On The Modern State of Dungeons and Dragons,2017-07-31,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/checking-in-on-the-modern-state-of-dungeons-and-dragons/,"Thanks to those plucky kids in Stranger Things and the larger proliferation of nerd culture, we’re happy to announce that Dungeons and Dragons is officially cool now. And as with many things that are either retaining or finding success almost a fifth of the way into this new century, DnD is doing it by adapting to the times. Groups can now conduct entire campaigns online (no more meeting in mom’s basement); YouTube, podcasts, etc. have created more DnD content than the average player knows what to do with; and the DnD-style role-playing game has expanded to multiple genres, so players who would rather walk on broken glass than participate in anything with the word “Dragons” in it, can play a comedy, horror or sci-fi RPG game.
DnD is so cool, its reach has expanded to prison, the coolest place. Yes, prisoners are playing DnD instead of dominoes or chess or the stabbing game (never heard of it? It’s the game where you just stab people).
The reach and stature of Dungeons has expanded so much, after having our first African-American president and our second criminally insane one, who knows, in a few years, we may have our first president who goes by Zudlud Geodeheart, the Deep Gnome Barbarian. President Geodeheart could probably pass some healthcare legislation. 
On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is taking his great axe, 100 gold, and a poison resistance elixir around Los Angeles for a sort-of state of the state of Dungeons and Dragons. First, he’s joined by Cracked’s Michael Swaim to speak with Spencer Crittenden of HarmonQuest, and they talk about what it’s like being one of the most famous Dungeon Masters in the world. Later, Alex speaks with documentarian Elisabeth De Kleer, whose viral article and video about prisoners who play DnD shines a humanizing light on how table-top RPG games can provide a therapeutic effect on the incarcerated and even patients with mental illnesses. Lastly, Alex sits down with Geoffrey Golden and Lee Keeler, who have adapted the cult-comedy classic “Wet Hot American Summer” into an RPG game coming out later this year.

Well the good news is nobody really knows. You’re not alone! The bad news is you were supposed to know by age 13 or so. And if you didn’t know back then, society’s been watching you flail around ever since. We’re a nation of human beings, facing more change and “economic anxiety” than ever before. And if you look close enough, you’ll realize the answer to that problem has a lot less to do with border walls and coal jobs, and a lot more to do with welcoming immigrants, encouraging adaptability, and rethinking our entire educational system.
On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Kristi Harrison, to point out our ongoing national crisis of mis-preparation derailing the lives of America’s teenagers, middle-aged parents, and everybody in between.

We’ve interviewed doctors, former cult members, and basically every kind of prostitute imaginable.
Despite the success of these articles, there’s been one thing we can’t translate adapting our hard-hitting interviews into text on a screen: our subjects’ voices. So, for the last year we’ve been secretly taping conversations to create a podcast version of our 10 favorite Personal Experience subjects, and that season 1 of that podcast is premiering this Wednesday as Cracked Gets Personal.
And this week on the show, Alex Schmidt is welcoming Cracked Gets Personal’s hosts, Robert Evans and Brandon Johnson, for a discussion of how this mini-series came together, how the Personal Experience articles get written and how CGP deftly tackles the subjects of police brutality, the opiod epidemic and butts…lots of things getting stuck up lots of butts.

The police arrive at the scene, engage in a bloody firefight and eventually a high-speed chase. But, once the suspect leave their line of sight, they just sort of…give up.
You are an NPC (non-playable character) in the Grand Theft Auto universe, where the long arm of the law only reaches as far as the computer’s AI will allow it and even getting arrested by the cops only means a couple of hours in jail and a couple hundred bucks coming from your pocket.
Fun world to live in as a regular-joe? Maybe. Depends on how much you value your life, justice and going bowling with your cousin.
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, we think about the little people in our favorite video game universes. What would it be like to be an NPC in GTA, Red Dead Redemption and Sim City? Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked’s Adam Ganser and Cristian Ramirez, and comedians Mike Drucker and Monika Scott to figure out which video game universe would be the best to live in and which one would be the worst?

Not in a Lady Gaga or Justin Bieber sort of way. He’s Weird Twitter-famous. He’s got half a million followers and he did it the hard way, by inhabiting the character of Jomny Sun, an alien visiting earth without any friends or a solid grasp of spelling in the English language.
Jonny’s now a published author, a playwright and an architect, he’s coded two of Twitter’s most popular bot accounts, oh, and he’s  studying for his doctorate at a little place called MIT. Heard of it?
Dude is super smart, super funny and while normal people like us have to practice and study to get better at things, he probably learns like Trinity in The Matrix learning how to fly a helicopter. So this week Alex Schmidt and Daniel O’Brien are joined by Jonny in-studio to talk about his book full of typos, juggling being an author-internet celebrity-architect-playwright and the state of internet cultures in 2017.

The Cracked Podcast,201,The Astoundingly Complex Logistics of How Food Gets Made,2017-09-04,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-astoundingly-complex-logistics-of-how-food-gets-made/,"If car commercials, beer commercials and presidential stump speeches were the only entertainment you consumed, you’d probably be pretty bored. You’d also think that American farmers are the life-blood of the economy and account for roughly 85% of the population. But in fact, less than 2% of Americans work in the business of putting food on your table– we’re talking farmers, ranchers, fishermen, etc.– and over 80% of us live in metropolitan areas of some sort. That’s a crazy ratio, especially when it comes to something as important as where the next meal is coming from.
How did we get here? How has the food industry in America gone from family farms and self reliance to drive throughs and endlessly stocked supermarkets in just a couple hundred years? This week, Alex Schmidt and Carmen Angelica speak to Maureen Ogle, a historian who wrote a whole book on the nuts and bolts of the American food industry and specifically, our obsession with meat.
Neither her book nor this podcast are condemnations of eating meat or exposés into the horrors of meat production, we’re just taking a look at the amazing confluence of business, agriculture, science and logistics that keeps the grocery shelves stocked and the McRib in rotation.

Wonder Woman was good! So was Spiderman! Guardians of the Galaxy was…a movie! What’s next? Oh no. Don’t say it. 
Justice League. [cue the sound of failure from The Price is Right]
All we’re saying is there are tons of great indie comics and obscure graphic novels that would make awesome movies that aren’t necessarily about super-powered people. So that’s what we’re talking about on this week’s podcast.
Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked’s resident comic experts Michael Swaim and Randall Maynard to pitch movie versions of 11 of their favorite un-adapted comics, including the Jodorowsky/Moebius collaboration that Luc Besson should’ve made before Valerian, a graphic novel that’s Casper the Friendly Ghost meets Lord of the Rings, and the Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead) series that should get a adapted next.

There are a lot more Alien: Covenants and Blade Runner: 2 0 49s than Ex Machinas. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s just sometimes sci-fi fans want to experience something new, something fresh, something that’s not in the Transformers expanded universe.
I mean, it’s 2017. There are new planets and technologies being discovered every day. Surely some of them would make for the basis of a good sci-fi movie.
So on this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt puts together a panel to research as many new and groundbreaking science stories as possible and pitch them as sci-fi movies. He’s joined live in New York at the Now Hear This podcast festival by Cracked’s Brett Rader and Michael Swaim, and comedians Claudia Cogan and Negin Farsad to discuss sense vests, head transplants, robot vines and more.

The Cracked Podcast,204,The Terrifying Truth About Why We Love Apocalypse Stories,2017-09-25,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-terrifying-truth-about-why-we-love-apocalypse-stories/,"From Mad Max to The Road to the illustrious career of Roland Emmerich, it’s clear that the modern pop-culture consumer loves apocalypses. Climate change and the threat of nuclear war or worldwide super-virus make imagining an apocalypse easy. And if you look back through history, it’s obvious that as long as there has been civilization, there has been the fear of complete and utter worldwide destruction.
One of the most prolific names today in speculative fiction is N.K. Jemisin. The first two books of her Broken Earth trilogy have won the Hugo Award for best novel the last two years consecutively. If you want to read the best sci-fi about the apocalypse, you need to be reading N.K. Jemisin’s books.

Jemisin was kind enough to join Cracked’s Alex Schmidt and Michael Swaim in New York for a conversation about world-building contemporary sci-fi, some of the most interesting real-life apocalypses in human history, and the difficulties of writing end-times fiction when the world so often is stranger and crueler than fiction.

Congratulations: you’ve survived several months of a Donald Trump presidency. And double congratulations: you’re pushing through this dark period despite having to experience it with a human brain. Our brains feel stress about everything from large predatory animals to low smartphone battery levels. Which begs the question: isn’t it worth wondering how those fragile organs are handling American history’s Dumbest Timeline?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt brings in Cracked POTUS-trackers Cody Johnston and Sean “Seanbaby” Reiley to discover the scale of President Trump’s towering horses**t, and the psychological ramifications of facing it day to day. They’ll shine a light on the most staggering, pointless lies ever told by the Commander in Chief. They’ll use the latest psychological studies to examine how constant chief executive lies can scramble our brains. And they’ll wrap up with ways you can be more mentally resilient than ever, both now and through the “The Rock” Johnson Administration.

Tokyo. Miami. Even if you’ve never been to these cities (and sometimes, even if you have) the visions that come rushing to your mind at the mere mention of their names are images from movies. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton on a park bench in front of the Queensboro Bridge, Scarlett Johansson wandering through Shibuya Crossing, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy doing Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy things in a boat on the Seine.
It’s a cliché, but certain world cities become characters in the movies in which they are set. And sometimes, **cough cough Judd Apatow**, movies are just set in the Los Angeles suburbs for no discernible reason other than the actors and director didn’t want to travel very far to get to work.
On this week’s podcast, inspired by and recorded in New York, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked’s Daniel Dockery, Brett Rader and Michael Swaim, as well former Cracked columnist Cher Martinetti, to discuss their 9 favorite movie locales and lay a city-sized crown on the one they think is the best place to set a movie.

Almost as if the writers and producers had time traveled themselves to watch Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and realized what a horrible idea that would be, Stoltz was recast, the title was changed to Back to the Future and Marty McFly gets back to the future by summoning 1.21 gigawatts through the power of lightning.
This is just one example of how studio notes aren’t always a bad thing. On this week’s episode, Alex Schmidt is joined by The Canon’s Amy Nicholson to discuss how movies like Alien, Forrest Gump, and Beverly Hills Cop were saved, or almost completely ruined by the scourge of Hollywood: studio notes.

With ghosts, this seems to be especially true. In some states, real estate listings must disclose if people have died at the property, you know, in case ghosts, and even the most fervent atheists will admit, “yeah there’s something weird opening doors in my house, it’s definitely a ghost.”

It’s psychology. Quite understandably, it’s human nature to fear disease. It’s why rats are icky to us and I ceremonially burn my clothes after I go to Disneyland. But if you know what you’re looking for, you’ll see how diseases are are framed as exotic and foreign as an excuse to gang up on different nationalities: SARS, ban Chinese people; Ebola, ban everybody from Africa; sickness in general, build that wall.

And spring is like a starter pistol for the annual sale of 72 million major league baseball tickets all across America Plus (“America Plus” is our fun brand name idea for The United States + Toronto). Whether or not you like baseball, you know it’s been the United States’s national obsession for over a century. But what if we told you baseball is ALSO a fascinating Rosetta Stone-like guide to a slew of bizarre truths about America? And what if we told you those truths might blow your mind EVEN MORE if you DON’T follow the game?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedian/writer/TV show creator Rhea Butcher and Cracked editor Dan Hopper for a deep dive into American culture, economics, morality, and awesomeness, all through the surprisingly revealing lens of Major League Baseball. They’ll tackle the racist 20th century cartoon that 21st century kids love. They’ll reveal how your tax dollars go into your nearest big city rich guy’s pocket, thanks to Congress’s ongoing bipartisan support. And they’ll rolodex the drugs, imperialism, sausage races, and goofy scooters that make America’s pastime as uniquely baffling as America itself.

In the story, the hummingbird’s forest catches fire. It’s burning out of control. And while the larger stronger animals cower, the hummingbird flies back and forth, putting drop after drop of water on the blaze. The big animals ask the hummingbird why it’s trying to put the fire out, since it seems too little and small-beaked to accomplish anything. The hummingbird’s simple reply: “I am doing what I can.”

And if you watch ANYTHING from the 1940s that involves marijuana, get ready for hilariously over-the-top scaremongering about the lethal horrors of jazz cigarettes. Now consider this: all that past pop culture seems strange now because it drew on the most forceful beliefs of its time. So what the heck is going to happen when OUR grandkids watch, stream, and play through the biggest hit pop culture of 2018?

And it definitely didn’t include skiers, on an indoor hill, in one of the world’s largest malls. 
No judgments here, friend: we all have misconceptions about the world. And some of your Middle Eastern mental picture may be accurate. But what if we told you there’s an entire world of big box stores, Lionel Richie fandom, and intricate cultural diversity out there just waiting for you to discover it?

It’s somehow a location and an industry and a big goofy hill-sign. It’s the source of all entertainment without entertaining us very often. And it’s where budding young artists flock to make it “big” (in Schwarzenegger’s case, literally). In popular consciousness, Hollywood is a sea of countless artists making our culture. But what if we told you the music world, movie world, and more pillars of American fun are driving by a shockingly tiny number of artists? And even weirder, the key artists are people you’ve never even heard of?

On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked editor Cyriaque Lamar for a journey through decades of comic book insanity.

But have you ever wondered why certain historical specifics get so much emphasis, while other facts get left by the wayside? Or why the name “Hitler” pops up in modern debates about everything from immigration to environmentalism to upsetting blog posts?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt and Jason Pargin (better known as David Wong) look back on the defining war of The American Century, and examine the bizarre ways it gets reinterpreted through the years. They’ll get into the geopolitical reasons why movies like ‘Patton’ and ’Saving Private Ryan’ celebrate some men and not others. They’ll consider the legions of historical monsters we ignore (or even laud!) in the process of cartoon-ifying World War II’s struggle. And maybe, just maybe, if enough people hear this show, not every random modern thing will get called “Hitler” without deserving it.

And everyone is abuzz about which of the perennial contenders (minus Italy, minus the Netherlands) will win it all. That passion for the game means big crowds, big glory, and big money.

But here’s a few TERRIFYING headlines saying otherwise: “The universe shouldn’t exist, according to science.” (New York Post) “The universe shouldn’t exist, scientists say after finding bizarre behaviour of anti-matter” (The Independent) “Universe shouldn’t exist, CERN physicists conclude.” (Cosmos Magazine) You might see those statements and think they sound increasingly convincing. First it was scientists saying stuff, then they brought anti-matter into it, and then holy cow here comes CERN. What a big official-looking acronym! 
All those stories spring from one study, which Physics Today and Gizmodo covered in a professional way. The study explained a huge leap forward in how we measure antiproton magnetic movement. One press release about it contained a borderline joke about the universe. And from there, all hell broke loose. Specifically, the same hell that keeps happening with discovery after discovery.

Strangely, this is even true in movies specifically about the sanctity of life, like <i>The Shape of Water</i>. Why is this? And is it getting worse?
Today Alex is joined by Cracked contributor Dan Hopper and writer/performer Kandice Martellaro to dissect a bunch of famous movies (even some good ones!) that are weirdly callous about people dying horrible, gruesome deaths.

Sure, they’re from different countries and they’re different species and one of them is a puppet. But in terms of taking your brain over by manipulating it with song, they’re the world’s foremost masters of a little trick called the appoggiatura. What is that magic Italian-derived word? How does it work? And how many other ways does the world prank your brain with music every day?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Jamie Brew (Botnik, Clickhole) for tales of tuneful brain trickery. They’ll dig through the latest brain science, the biggest pop songs of today, and the history of opera for ways your noggin hears music and messes with you as a result. Also, this one has some fun musical examples! So how about that!

The Cracked Podcast,258,9 Supposedly Important Words (That Don’t Mean Anything),2018-09-23,,https://www.earwolf.com/episode/9-supposedly-important-words-that-dont-mean-anything/,"Have you visited America’s heartland? And if you have…why are you so sure? “The heartland” is not a defined thing, with borders or flags or land made of literal hearts. The term actually comes from a British geographer named Halford Mackinder (a fantastic name), who coined “heartland” in 1904 to describe one central part of pre-WWI Europe. So why do we use “heartland” in the present day, to describe an aspect of the U.S.? Is it to imply ideas about it, without letting you consider those ideas on their merits? And are there other words in our language that get used the same way?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (better known as David Wong) to explore the most celebrated words in the English language that also trick us constantly. They’ll examine how throwing around the term “real” messes with everything from our gender roles to our dinner plate to our politics. They’ll uncover the creepy way certain words throw entire generations under the bus. And they’ll explore why philosophies like socialism and fascism are making a comeback in places like America’s Heartland (whatever that is).

For example, ‘Ready Player One’ began its life as a bestselling novel by Ernest Cline. In their “A”-graded write-up in 2011, The AV Club said “for readers in line with Cline’s obsessions, this is a guaranteed pleasure.” Yet by 2018, when ‘RPO’ got a Steven Spielberg film adaptation, that same review site gave the movie a “B” grade with a side of savage criticism: “Like Ernest Cline’s divisive geek-courting novel, the film doesn’t offer much of a story or characters, instead spreading out an endless buffet of pop-culture references, flattering the preoccupations and encyclopedic recall of its target audience.” Does that make any sense? Was aggressive fandom better a few years back? Or has the dark side of really liking a thing turned too dark, too often?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedians Caitlin Gill and Riley Silverman for a range of stories about how to be the absolute best pop culture fan you can be. They’ll focus on tales of fans connecting with creators, changing the shape of their favorite art, and putting themselves into it. They’ll also mull the dark side of intense fandom. And with everything from ‘Doctor Who’ to ‘Spider-Man’ about to premiere new installments, they’ll point to how you can be somebody who makes the world of fandom brighter.

After all, there’s a whole class about them every year in school. Also various scientific studies say our brains get concrete benefits from reading the written word. But what do we gain when that word is read to us? What do we gain when we let a writer’s meaning reach us like never before? And what happens to society itself when literature takes on the role of prototyping our future?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with the one and only LeVar Burton, host of the incredible ‘LeVar Burton Reads’ podcast. If you’ve watched TV in the last 40 years, LeVar’s gotten you excited about books directly (‘Reading Rainbow’), indirectly (the original ‘Roots’ TV adaptation), and science fictionally (decades of ‘Star Trek’ acting and directing). Today he and Alex explore how the world’s reacted to LeVar’s unique literary mission. They’ll also walk through a history of science fiction prototyping, the near future of ‘Trek’ storytelling, and what literacy can do for all our futures if we let it.

Maybe you complain about it to your friends. Maybe you nail its flaws with a sly tweet, or share a damning critical review. If you use any of those forms of outrage, it’s probably because failed art can feel like it’s happening TO us, not for us. But what if we told you anybody can take ownership of their viewing experience? What if holding one fun idea in your mind throughout an okay movie can change it into unforgettable entertainment? And most amazing of all: what if that could make ‘Star Wars’ prequels kind of watchable?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedian writer & memoir-master Guy Branum for a celebration of fan theories, headcanons, and other ways to read a movie better. They’ll re-discover everything from Julia Roberts’ heyday to Disney’s darkest hour. They’ll turn football movies into the Shakespearean tragedies they’ve always been. And if they can find the strength to do it, they’ll make ‘Entourage’ into something miraculously watchable.

Great, experiment complete. Now examine what you came up with. It’s almost definitely one of two things: 1) a specific extraterrestrial from a movie or show, who you can point to as from that movie/show. 2) what’s known as a “Grey” — a small humanoid with a large teardrop head and two face-dominating eyes. That second kind of Grey Alien dominates our cultural conception of life from other planets. But where did it come from? And what does it say about our larger belief in everything from dragons to werewolves to the scariest monsters ever invented?
On this spooktacular episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (who writes for the site as David Wong). They’ll dig into the creepiest “true” story Jason’s ever encountered. They’ll also explore monster lore from the Salem Witch Trials to Slenderman creepypasta to the myth of The Deep State. And they’ll consider whether all monsters, human and otherwise, come from a cultural & psychological source that’s scarier than anything you could dress as for Halloween.

You might even remember a few details: a ship sinking in Cuba, the U.S. taking over Puerto Rico, Teddy Roosevelt riding a horse…and once you answered a couple test questions about that, you moved on forever. To most people, the wars that define America involve George Washington winning, Adolf Hitler losing, and the Russians pointing nukes at us and frowning. But what if a brief American conflict in the year 1898 did just as much to shape the entire world’s destiny? And what if people of that time knew their votes in a few key elections would make all the difference?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Stephen Kinzer, author of ‘The True Flag: Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain, and the Birth of American Empire’. Alex & Stephen dig into The Spanish-American War, and why it’s the most important American war nobody in America ever thinks about. They’ll look at how a little-known U.S. Senator, an even lesser-known populist silver freak, and the legacy of the Spanish Inquisition shape all our lives today. And they’ll consider how modern voters could finally answer the question of what America is supposed to be in the world, and answer it in a way where everybody benefits.

You’d immediately go into Working Your Ass Off Mode, right? After all, if you’re spending one whole million U.S. dollars, you’d want to make sure the script and production were as perfect as they could be. Now here’s the next version of that thought experiment: what if you got to spend FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS? What if you got to spend it making an Avengers story that tied together ten years of filmmaking? And here’s the scary part: what if your story forgot to make it clear that the villain was, ya know, on the wrong side of the conflict? 
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedy writers Chase Mitchell and Ben Joseph for a look at how some of the biggest movies of all time forgot to prove that their villain was in the wrong. And if they’re lucky they’ll find a way to explain how films from ‘The Little Mermaid’ to ‘Mission: Impossible – Fallout’ to ‘Avengers Thanos-stravaganza’ screwed up the basic building block of “good versus evil” without audiences noticing.

Another set ought to prevent us from falling for that garbage if other people pull it. But what if certain people don’t have that first limitation?

From serious movies about American history to serious movies about British history, no subject wins more votes and locks down more statues. Of course the people making those movies would tell you they’re super serious because history was that way, so what else can they do. But what if every period drama could be funnier AND realer if it got over itself? And what if eras from ancient Rome to the twentieth century Cold War featured real hijinks that are so hilarious, so wild, so straight-up funny, Hollywood refused to show them to you?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt and Dan Hopper explore that exact phenomenon. They’ll pick apart some of the greatest historical dramas and biopics of all time, take you behind the production curtain, and pick out the hilarious elements filmmakers just didn’t have the guts to put in.

Because if you’re not all that good at reading Latin or other dead languages, good news: you could have still had a job as an 1800s historian. Fun example: there’s a story claiming the Roman emperor Caligula was SO CRAZY, he sent a whole army to a beach to pick up seashells for him. However, the Latin word ‘musculi’ means both “shells” and “military huts”, so he likely actually told his troops to pack up their campsite. Which is normal.

It could be the title of a 1950s B-movie where a mad scientist vaporizes a dance party. But when sociologists use that term, “social atomization” is a complementary set of shifts you might have noticed lately: more loneliness, less societal trust, and an increasing feeling that nobody’s got your back. What does it mean if that’s happening to all of us? How can that happen without anybody intending it? And can that impact everything from your personal health to your national government?

They’ll take a trip down historical memory lane, and look into the most fascinating stories of right now, to find every amazing biopic Hollywood should have already made (and still can make).

Hard-charging, in-leaning, unstoppable titans of industry want everyone to know it. One of their favorite brags: never sleeping more than a few hours a night. Is that actually a cool thing?

But this week’s episode is about EVERY Oscars ceremony. Why? Because the Oscars dictate most of your movie-watching year: October-December = “good movies”, January-February = “failed attempts at good movies”, summertime = “movies seeking the big green Oscar better known as MONEY.” So we asked ourselves a question. We asked what might happen if the Oscars stopped dictating that schedule? And what if they stopped dictating it because the Oscars stopped happening at all, freeing up all of pop culture to function differently (and maybe function better)?
On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, please enjoy the oracular brilliance and Hollywood wisdom of comedians/podcasters Caitlin Gill, Dan Hopper, Amy Nicholson, and Danielle Radford, who joined Alex Schmidt for this LIVE episode from the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles.
