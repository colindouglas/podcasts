As is to be expected, the first few episodes are where the show finds its footings, and that it does! Rob Huebel from TV’s “Human Giant”, Tom Lennon from TV’s “The State”, and Doug Benson from TV’s “Last Comic Standing” make Scott’s first episode an immediate hit. Hear some music from today’s hottest comedy musicians, have your twitter questions answered, and hear an abbreviated version of Doug Loves Movies on this episode.","Rob Huebel, Thomas Lennon, Doug Benson"
2009-05-08,2,Reggaeton Soundboard,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/reggaeton-soundboard/,"It doesn’t take a show like Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast long to get some grade-A guests. Guests like SNL’s Kevin Nealon? Yes, guests like SNL’s Kevin Nealon! And before Aziz Ansari became a huge hit with Raaaaaaaandy, he was a huge hit with his Reggaeton Soundboard. All of this plus more of Doug Loves Movies and songs from The Lonely Island, The Reigning Monarchs, and Hard ‘n Phirm make this episode a great one to grow from.","Aziz Ansari, Kevin Nealon, Doug Benson"
2009-05-15,3,Never Date a “Brown”,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/never-date-a-brown/,"One of the best parts of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast is the way it introduces tremendously funny people to a wider audience. How many of you knew who Jackie Clarke was before this episode? Oh yeah, I forgot most of you are nerds. Well, did you have ANY idea that the author Greg Behrendt is also a comedian? Oh right, he’s an amazing legendary comedian we’ve all known and loved for years. Well, how about the fact…aww, nevermind this game is no fun. Of course you all know that Nick Thune is tremendously hilarious! Just go on and listen!","Greg Behrendt, Jackie Clarke, Nick Thune"
2009-05-22,4,Special Nerdist Edition,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/special-nerdist-edition/,"Four episodes in and Scott is ALREADY chickening out? Geesh! Well, fortunately the Nerdist Chris Hardwick steps in and does a flat-out awesome job taking over the hosting reigns. With Mike Phirman and Matt Mira on his side, they are unstoppable, and it doesn’t hurt that they’ve got Doug Loves Movies if all else fails!","Chris Hardwick, Matt Mira, Mike Phirman, Doug Benson"
2009-05-29,5,Guest Host Jimmy Pardo,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/guest-host-jimmy-pardo/,"Jimmy Pardo is the host of his own show, Never Not Funny, so one would assume that he’d be a good host of Comedy Bang Bang. Well, one would be right! Except for the boring politicians he had on, the show is absolutely phenomenal. Representative Richard Martin and his wife Jazz slow the pace down a bit, but Paul Stanley from KISS brings his rocking attitude in to bring the energy back. All of this plus music from Garfunkel & Oates, a Half-Assed Sports Report, and Doug Loves Movies.","Paul Gilmartin, Maria Bamford,  Garfunkel & Oates, Matt Belknap, Pat Francis, Doug Benson"
2009-06-05,7,Double Co-Hosts,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/double-co-hosts/,"An episode with two co-hosts? It cannot be! Well, it is…but, when they’re The Sklar Brothers you can hardly call them two separate entities. With the comedic force of Scott, Jason and Randy, and Paul F. Tompkins, you’d think unfunny was impossible…that is unless you’re newly traumatized observational comic Cal Shipsby. Fortunately things take a lighter turn when the writer of Look Who’s Talking, Jerry Jimson, stops by and talks about his process. And I’d be remiss not to mention that this episode features Doug Loves Movies!","Paul F. Tompkins, Paul Rust, Jason Sklar, Randy Sklar, Doug Benson"
2009-06-19,8,The New Doctor Demento,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-new-doctor-demento/,"Dr. Demento was arguably the most famous comedy radio host…that is, until Scott Aukerman joined the business! The key to Demento’s success was one Mr. “Weird Al” Yankovic, who Scott steals away to bring himself fame. On this episode they discuss Al’s success and music and are joined by celebrated author Richard Dalton and winner of the Indie 103.1 Unknown Comic Contest Jim Pipe.","Weird Al Yankovic, Paul Scheer, Doug Benson"
2009-06-26,9,R.I.P. Michael Jackson,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/rip-michael-jackson/,"While the death of Michael Jackson put a damper on the comedy community, Scott Aukerman bravely decided to do his show anyways, if nothing else than to put a smiling face on all the grievers and mourners out there. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t expecting a visit from the ghost of Michael Jackson himself. To round out the table (if that’s an expression) Scott has topical comedy genius Neil Hamburger and friend of Michael Jackson’s, R.O. Manse join in to voice their condolences. Dax Shepard co-hosts this beautiful tribute to a lost legend.","Dax Shepard, Chip Pope, Neil Hamburger, Paul F. Tompkins"
2009-07-03,10,Comedy Vs. Music,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/comedy-vs-music/,"They say every musician wants to be a comedian and every comedian wants to be a musician. I happen to think Aimee Mann just enjoys being friends with comedians, but you can’t help but pick up on how funny she is. She and Morgan Murphy bring up the estrogen level of the show as Morgan discusses dirty texts and bad dates. And while the show tries to stay away from advertising, Todd Wickey comes in to talk about the bakery for dogs he runs.","Aimee Mann, Morgan Murphy, Seth Morris, Doug Benson"
2009-07-10,11,Birthday Checks!,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/birthday-checks/,"Two words: Birthday Checks! That’s right, it’s the premiere of Weirder Scott’s first ever single! But before you fast forward over to that, be sure to listen to Officer Dick Butterfield who has some great safety tips for the summertime.

Doug Loves Movies, Half-Assed Sports Report, Twitter Questions and more, on this episode of Comedy Bang Bang.","Rob Huebel, Jason Sklar, Randy Sklar, Doug Benson"
2009-07-17,12,The Baby’s Sunglasses,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-babys-sunglasses/,"It only took Scott twelve, count ’em, TWELVE episodes to get an Emmy nominee on the show! And that nominee is the fine sir Jon Hamm. He talks about being famous, blah blah blah, and assists El Chupacabra by helping him advertise pajamas. Howard Kremer talks about his love of music, and his love of the town of Austin, TX, while Bobby Bottleservice talks about his love of alcohol and women. Plus, Doug Loves Movies!","Jon Hamm, Nick Kroll, Howard Kremer"
2009-07-24,13,Jimmy Pardo’s Back,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/jimmy-pardos-back/,"Pardo is back! While most fans loved his last appearance, a certain country disc jockey named A.J. Christopher had some issues with it and came on to give Jimmy advice. But it isn’t all hate for Pardo, The Shaman performs an original Ode to Jimmy Pardo live from the studio! Jimmy Dore is there to bring the funny, especially when Ice T tries SO hard to take the funny away. All this and Doug Loves Movies on this episode of Comedy Bang Bang!","Jimmy Pardo, Jason Nash, Jimmy Dore, Doug Benson, Paul F. Tompkins"
2009-07-31,14,An Old Fashioned Dinner,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/an-old-fashioned-dinner/,"Sometimes really talented comedians get some fame.

They bring in new L.A. resident Chelsea Peretti in for some great improvisation and sketch work, like a Cheaters remake and Bob’s last words on his death bed. Several moments from this episode made the “Best of ’09” episode, so you won’t want to miss out!","Andy Dick, Bob Odenkirk, Chelsea Peretti"
2009-08-21,17,Live from Downtown Franklin,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/live-from-downtown-franklin/,"Unfortunately, Tom Lennon had a hard time getting to the show on time. Fortunately, the new announcer Lil’ Gary was there to keep the pace up. In between Gary’s shouts of confusion, you’ll hear some hi-larious jokes by Matt Braunger and hear about Matt Walsh’s new business plans.","Matt Walsh, Thomas Lennon, Matt Braunger"
2009-08-28,18,Poppin’ Bottles,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/poppin-bottles/,"It’s always great when Scott brings on his friends from Mr. Show, but it’s hard not to be disappointed by the fact that Jerry Minor has given up comedy in place of music. Granted, he’s an amazing musician, as you’ll hear, but it’s still disappointing. Fortunately the fabulous Andy Kindler is there to keep the funny flowing. Brendon Walsh makes his first appearance and talks about his comedy beginnings, as well as his comedy currents.","Andy Kindler, Brendon Walsh, Jerry Minor"
2009-09-04,19,SNL Reunion,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/snl-reunion/,"Rarely does the show go super-informative-like, but this episode is a great look into the life of the “Not Ready for Prime Time Players” that make up Saturday Night Live. From the classic Laraine Newman, to the modern Casey Wilson, and the fan-favorite Kevin Nealon learn about the evolution of America’s most famous sketch show.","Kevin Nealon, Laraine Newman, Casey Wilson"
2009-09-11,20,World Premiere of Tangelo,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/world-premiere-of-tangelo/,"Of course we all miss Mr. Show, but fortunately Scott recreates the magic by having on Mary Lynn Rajskub. She updates us on what has happened in her life since 1996, and that one show she’s on. It’s a number or something….ugh, do you guys know what I’m talking about? Ugh, well…Reggie Watts makes his first appearance which is one of the greatest things that has happened in the world. The only thing that could make the episode better: Rory Scovel! Oh, and one other thing, Scott Aukerman’s new hit single Tangelo! And one more thing…oh wait, that’s it. Scratch that.","Mary Lynn Rajskub, Reggie Watts, Rory Scovel"
2009-09-18,21,Morning Becomes Oddly Racist,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/morning-becomes-oddly-racist/,"I know a lot of you have been complaining about the fast paced comedic nature of the show, so we thought we’d bring in Nathan Brantley from Morning Becomes Eclectic to slow the pace down a bit. It’s kind of hard to do that when you’ve got the comedic genius of Chris Hardwick and Charlene Yi at work. They try the first (and as of typing, last) ever game of What Is It Wearing and Charlene shows off some of her talent for impressions and music.","Charlyne Yi, Chris Hardwick, Seth Morris"
2009-09-25,22,Yet Another Pardo-sode,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/yet-another-pardo-sode/,"And here we are, yet another appearance of Jimmy Pardo. You’d think he’d grow tired of the live radio scene, but when he’s got great guests like shock jock Kirk rocker and Paul Stanley from KISS to help him out how can you complain? Add universally loved comedian Dana Gould and the founder of ASpecialThing.com Matt Belknap and you have a fabulous episode for your ears to feast upon.","Jimmy Pardo, Dana Gould, Doug Benson, Matt Belknap, Pat Francis"
2009-09-25,B1,Live from Vancouver!,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/live-from-vancouver/,"When Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast goes in front of a live audience, you never know what to expect! Like an audience not really understanding just what it is that Todd Barry is doing. Or that Ice T might look nothing like he does when he’s acting on TV’s Law and Order. But you can always count on Would You Rather, Garfunkel & Oates, Nick Thune, and the most famous and beloved segment: The Patented Chime-Off.","Todd Barry, Nick Thune, Paul F.

2009-10-16,25,We’re Down for Whatewers,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/were-down-for-whatewers/,"Comedy has always been a young man’s game, which is perhaps why Neil Hamburger cannot get an audience to do anything but boo and hiss until his set ends. You’d think they’d enjoy his stuff, as so much of it is about Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears and the other people who keep this culture running. Maybe it’s because of his opening act, Mike O’Connell. I mean, he’s the type of guy who you keep your babies far away from, especially if they are Asian. Fortunately the somewhat likeable political analyst Anthony Rivera drops in who is “down for like whatewers.”","Brent Weinbach, Mike O'Connell, Neil Hamburger"

I bet it isn’t as funny as Andy Richter’s answer! How would you serenade a porn star? I bet it isn’t as melodious as Sarah Silverman’s song! What would you ask Elvis Costello if you could ask him anything? I bet it isn’t as hard-hitting as Scott Aukerman’s questions!,"Sarah Silverman, Andy Richter"

2009-11-06,28,Did Somebody Sit on a Duck?,http://www.earwolf.com/episode/did-somebody-sit-on-a-duck/,"Theme-episodes aren’t Comedy Bang Bang’s forte, so why Scott wanted to have a Philly episode we’ll never understand. I mean, Paul F. Tompkins and Todd Glass I get, but (the great Dr.) Bill Cosby? And he’s become such a shill! Well, listen anyways, for Paul and Todd at least.","Todd Glass, Paul F. Tompkins, Jon Daly"
